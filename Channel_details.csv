It's awesome, it's quick, turns easy. It's amazing. It's the smoothest forklift I've ever driven. Very smooth, very easy to get on and off. Very responsive. I was really surprised by how quiet it was. I could feel more power than the old unit. It was really maneuverable. Long run times per battery charge and the efficiency of the controls and motors to be able to achieve that I think is something that everybody can take advantage of. Sightlines were incredible - being able to see where I was going. The regenerative breaking, when you're taking the tight turns on the forklift, I mean, it's smooth again, but the handling, going around the corners at high speeds - it's a quality forklift, you can tell. Updated look to it - the curved and linear design and the efficiency of the motors. I like the lowered assist grip in the back. The low cost of ownership, the run times, the new and improved run times, I think they'll be really excited about. The prolonged life of the Toyota product. The Toyota Genuine Parts that have been implemented on this new vehicle, I think it's going to be a game changer for the customers in the future. I know our customers are really going to like the comfort and the smoothness of the way this unit operates. Well, I think just the truck as a new Toyota Product itself is a great thing to lead with, because Toyota always comes out with new, innovative products. And then, as far as everything else is concerned, then go over the features and benefits of the truck.

Conveyors may be powered or unpowered, and the type of conveyor that’s used usually depends on this difference.

131,0,Pacline Overhead Conveyors,What are Towline Conveyors?,False,"https://www.pacline.com/products/towline-floor-conveyors/

This video demonstrates the power and simplicity of an on-floor towline conveyor system designed to transport a wide range of large, extremely heavy or very awkward products.

The PAC-TRAK™ 100 towline conveyor has several unique features that benefit the heavy load applications.  First, only a very shallow trench is required to install the drive unit and the motor drive sits above floor for easy service and maintenance.  Secondly, the heavy duty PT 100 chain system is quiet, smooth and has a built in slack adjustment.  And thirdly, the curve load capacity features free turning roller capstans to guide the chain and its load around any curve. This removes the chance of heavy wear on the inside of the track and allows the movement of a heavy load through any turn with far less power required from the drive unit.

As with all PACLINE towline conveyors, the top platens which support and carry the products can be customized to the size, shape and weight of the products carried. They can be designed to rotate manually for easy access to all sides by operators, or programmed to automatically stop, start or rotate for close packing in accumulation zones, at specific points along the controlled track system.

A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems. A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with an endless loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the belt forward. The powered pulley is called the drive pulley while the unpowered pulley is called the idler pulley. There are two main industrial classes of belt conveyors; Those in general material handling such as those moving boxes along inside a factory and bulk material handling such as those used to transport large volumes of resources and agricultural materials, such as grain, salt, Lime stone, Clinker, Cement, coal, ore, sand, overburden and more.

154,0,Rulmeca Corporation,Belt Pull and Power for Inclined Conveyors,False,"Mike Gawinski explains how to calculate required belt pull and required conveyor drive power on an inclined package handling belt conveyor. For a free copy of the company's power calculation program go to:
https://rulmecacorp.com/bulk-handling-power-calculation-program/
0:00 Introduction
0:19 Inclined Conveyors
0:41 Belt Pull Calculation
0:56 Belt Pull to Overcome Friction
2:02 Belt Pull to Overcome Gravity
2:46 Converting to HP
4:06 Comparison of Horizontal and Inclined Conveyors

This video explains how to calculate belt pull and required power to move discreet packages on an inclined slider bed conveyor.  An understanding of the basic aspects of conveyor bulk pull is essential to properly designing, operating and maintaining belt conveyors. We know that the power required to move a load on a belt conveyor equals belt pull times belt speed.

Required Power = Belt Pull x Belt Speed

The belt pull required to move packages on an inclined slider bed conveyor equals the belt pull required to overcome friction plus the belt pull required to overcome gravity.

Belt Pull Required to Overcome Friction:
The belt pull required to overcome friction equals the total weight of all packages, plus the weight of the belt times the coefficient of friction between the bottom of the conveyor belt and the top of the slider bed.

For example, if a 10 foot long conveyor moves five 50 pound boxes simultaneously at a belt speed of 50 feet per minute on a conveyor belt with a weight of 3 lbs/ft, on a slider bed with a frictional coefficient of 0.5, then the belt pull to overcome friction is calculated as follows.  First, calculate total weight.

Total Weight = 5 packages x 50 lbs/package + 10 feet of belt x 3 lbs/ft
Total Weight  = 250 lbs + 30 lbs = 280 lbs

Belt pull required to overcome friction equals total weight times frictional coefficient between the bottom of the belt and the top of the slider bed.

Belt Pull = Total Weight x frictional coefficient
Belt Pull = 280 lbs x 0.5
Belt Pull = 140 lbs

Belt Pull Required to Overcome Gravity:
Belt pull required to overcome gravity equals the weight per foot of the load on the conveyor times the change in elevation of the conveyor.  In this example, we have five boxes at 50 lbs/box, which equals a total load of 250 lbs.

Since the conveyor is 10 feet long, the average weight per foot of load on the belt equals 250 lbs divided by 10 ten, which equals 25 lbs/foot.

Belt pull = Weight per Foot of Load x Change in Elevation
Belt pull = 25 lbs/ft x 3 feet
Belt pull = 75 lbs.

Total Required Belt Pull = Belt Pull to Overcome Friction + Belt Pull to Overcome Gravity
Total Required Belt Pull = 140 lbs + 75 lbs
Total Required Belt Pull = 215 lbs

Then, convert this to required power.

Required Power = Belt Pull x Belt Speed

Required Power = 215 lbs x 50 fpm = 10,750 ft-lbs/min

Convert that to a useful unit of measure.  One horsepower (HP) equals 33,000 ft-lbs/min. Therefore, our power requirement can be converted as follows.

Required Power = (10,750 ft-lbs/min)/(33,000 ft-lbs/min per HP)

Required Power = 0.33 HP

Now we can select an appropriate conveyor drive system.

Compare this ""inclined conveyor"" example with the ""horizontal conveyor"" described in our previous video.  Note that a change from a horizontal conveyor to an inclined conveyor with a 3 foot change in elevation (all other parameters remaining constant) results in a power requirement which is more than 50% higher.

The inclined conveyor requires 0.33 HP while the horizontal conveyor only requires 0.2 HP.  This underlines the fact that it is always important to calculate belt pull required to overcome gravity as well as belt pull required to overcome friction in inclined conveyors.",,330,2020-07-27,10015,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSZCQCSZ7MiKG02jftHm-QA/about,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fi4mhHV9rE>,Rulmeca Corporation

178,0,PV-Supa,Automated Material Handling System Demonstration (AMHS),False,"The Libretto Automated Material Handling System (AMHS) made by P.V. Supa is a fully modular system, suitable for all kinds and sizes of libraries, with a minimum of one sorting position up to a maximum of 255 sorting positions.
The Libretto AMHS is of modular construction, each module being responsible for a specific function in the AMHS. Because of this, the AMHS can be customized to fit the needs of any library. The modularity makes installing the system in a library easy, even in existing facilities. The modular structure also enables the devices to be extended and reconfigured later, for example by adding sorting positions or inlets.
While designing the AMHS, P.V. Supa has taken into account the library’s own logistics needs. There are several different add-ons to choose from which will help handling returned material and improve workplace ergonomy.
Libretto software
Libretto software has been in use for over a decade all over the world. It provides a clear and easy to use interface for patrons to operate the AMHS device with. Libretto has an easy and flexible connection to a library system using standard SIP-protocol. Libretto has unlimited number of choices for sorting the returned material, and sorting can be easily adjusted by the library staff.
Sorting
Libretto can use either the sorting data from a library system or the sorting rules can be based on information returned in SIP messages. Libretto can handle an unlimited amount of sorting categories, and the sorting can be easily adjusted by library staff at any time.
Program options
PV-Messaging is used to distribute information from P.V. Supa’s units to the library staff stations with Message board software, staff mobile phones with text messages or via email. PV-Messaging sends information about different situations that require staff to take notice, or about possible errors in the system. This allows the device to be left unattended because it will notify the staff if it needs attention.

Material handling equipment (MHE) is mechanical equipment used for the movement, storage, control and protection of materials, goods and products throughout the process of manufacturing, distribution, consumption and disposal.The different types of handling equipment can be classified into four major categories:transport equipment, positioning equipment, unit load formation equipment, and storage equipment.

Transport equipment
Transport equipment is used to move material from one location to another (e.g., between workplaces, between a loading dock and a storage area, etc.), while positioning equipment is used to manipulate material at a single location. The major subcategories of transport equipment are conveyors, cranes, and industrial trucks. Material can also be transported manually using no equipment.

Conveyors
Conveyors are used when material is to be moved frequently between specific points over a fixed path and when there is a sufficient flow volume to justify the fixed conveyor investment.

Electric Tugs
An electric tug is a small battery powered and pedestrian operated machine capable of either pushing or pulling a significantly heavier load than itself. 

Cranes are used to transport loads over variable (horizontal and vertical) paths within a restricted area and when there is insufficient (or intermittent) flow volume such that the use of a conveyor cannot be justified. 

Industrial trucks are trucks that are not licensed to travel on public roads (commercial trucks are licensed to travel on public roads

Storage equipment is used for holding or buffering materials over a period of time. The design of each type of storage equipment, along with its use in warehouse design, represents a trade-off between minimizing handling costs, by making material easily accessible, and maximizing the utilization of space (or cube)

188,0,CompassAutomation,Automated Dimensional Inspection and Material Handling System,False,"This Automated Dimensional Inspection and Material Handling System was designed to inspect and serialize worm gear hubs for a customer located in Croydon, PA. 

Parts are manually loaded into six in-feed magazines, each holding a maximum of 40 parts. When a magazine is actuated into the load position, a proximity switch is activated, alerting a 2-axis robot to the presence of parts.

The robot, seen here, consists of a horizontal and vertical axis, allowing it to pick from all 6 in-feed magazines and from various positions in each stack. The robot places a part onto a 6-position dial table

At the first position on the dial, a sensor verifies that the part has been loaded correctly, and an air knife blows debris out of the inner diameter of the part, cleaning the part prior to inspection.

At the second position on the dial, an air Gage, mounted on a single-axis robot engages the part, measuring the inner diameter at 3 positions (top, middle, and bottom).

At the third position on the dial, a laser marker marks the part. Here, a shield surrounds the laser, protecting the operator from harmful radiation. Each part is marked with a 2-D data matrix, consisting of the date of inspection, the shift number, and a discrete serial number. The air gage readings for each part are stored to a database enabling quality personnel to verify that each individual part has passed inspection.

In the final station, a smart camera grades the data matrix, ensuring that the code is legible.

After inspection, marking, and grading, the part is indexed into the off-load position, where a pneumatic actuator picks the part and places it onto an off-load conveyor. 

This machine processes one part every 10 seconds.

Equipment selection principle: Consider all aspect of material, move and method to be utilized.
Dead weight principle: Reduce the ratio of dead weight to pay load in mobile equipment.
Motion principle: Equipment designed to transport material should be kept in motion.
Idle time principle:Reduce idle time/unproductive time of both MH equipment and man power.
Maintenance principle:Plan for preventive maintenance or scheduled repair of all handling equipment.
Obsolescence principle: Replace obsolete handling methods/equipment when more efficient method/equipment will improve operation.
Capacity principle: Use handling equipment to help achieve its full capacity.
Control principle:Use material handling equipment to improve production control, inventory control and other handling.
Performance principle:Determine efficiency of handling performance in terms of cost per unit handled which is the primary criterion.
