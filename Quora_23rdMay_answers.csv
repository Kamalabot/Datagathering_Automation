I am from Mechanical engineering background and started self_learning programming. Before 4 years I had come across open MiT courseware. There the author is taking the introductory course of the same name.
The structure of book made me look at the world of computers differently. Instead of thinking programs as some abstract line of symbols, the book teaches you how to write functions that are similar to physical object.
Intro to OOP concept is done in a by real world scenario. A drunken guy walking.It is fun to see how the random number can generate patterns and finally provide insights about the environment that the simulation is conducted.
There are many other books on problem solving, text processing, visualization can help. This book wild give a solid intro to all these areas.
Programming is a tool like our pen or screw, bolts and nuts. (You can think of your own domain tools).We programmers create new things out these Components. These components have to work and solve the problem or provide some understanding. With that objective, learning programming will be a breeze."
3,https://www.quora.com/What-is-considered-an-expert-in-Python/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,11,–,www.quora.com,What-is-considered-an-expert-in-Python,"There are 2 kind of experts. Person is talented or pioneer in Python then he will be called as Pythoneer. Person using python language to achieve his implementations will be called as Pythonista. That is answer given by Google. Let me dive a bit deep on what it takes to become an expert
Programming languages help to solve the problem in the real world. If you have a one time problem then it is not worth writing a program to solve it. Logic is, your time is worth more spent solving some other problem. So programming languages “Help” to solve problem as a tool in which one can enter the instructions, and get the computer to solve it repetitively. Think about the many things, that we were doing manually… (Going to bank, drawing money with a Cheque or DD!!! It is a time when life was boring and least complicated)
In other words, Pythoneer tries to use novel libraries, techniques or algorithms to solve a problem. Pythonista uses good practices, clever know how of compiler workings and achieves more by writing less. Other languages have their own mastery terminologies.
Allow me to go a bit overboard and share the track for becoming an expert.
These are the skills that Pythonistas, and Pythoneer excel at. Before writing code, knowing what is already written can save lot of effort, and time. So research, read and experiment a lot. Happy Pythoning…"

In order for these models to work with reasonable accuracy, dataset for long period of time needs to be fed. These models try to learn the signals between the intervals, and in case of RNN and LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory) they remember the past.
AI algorithms are free in the sense of open source. The models, the program, connecting APIs are available in multiple languages to download and use. Critical point is having the knowledge and experience to use these models.
I had been exploring ways to learn ML for couple of months. There are many free platform which you can use for learning. Search in Google for “ML Model training” or “Learning ML” or something in that line. There are data version control software that allow you to control your data, experimentation and finally hypothesize your findings.
Before going to ML, think about traditional ways of predicting the quantity of issues. ML and AI are useful when the parameters are very large, in hundreds or atleast above 50. Even in ML, there are more choices to make when it comes to model selection. So underlying domain knowledge does play a crucial role…."

Data Science is application of statistics and mathematics with help of algorithms. Data is the fuel for the vehicle who engine is mathematics, chassis is statistics and finally the wiring is Algorithms. You need all of these to work properly to drive the vehicle, and safely reach your goal. Any number of analogies can be provided, but algorithms trump.
I am a decision maker and every day I have to hundreds of decision. I strive to decide every decision logically. Logically means, thinking through the choices and calculation what will be the effect of the decision I am taking. Whether the outcome will be favorable to me or not. A game of sort is constantly played.
Data scientists automates this game for millions of decision makers around the world. Brings their decisions and their outcomes in one place, analysis the data and tries to predict, who will make what kind of decision.
Take time to learn about the algorithms, and even write them by yourself by learning the intricate basics of the libraries and books. The community has been very supportive and shared lot of researches, books for aspiring data scientists to learn."
9,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-websites-to-practice-Python-coding-and-help-others/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,152,–,www.quora.com,What-are-some-good-websites-to-practice-Python-coding-and-help-others,"I had tried learning to solve problems through code for past 10 to 12 years, started and stopped many times. I stared by learning C, and then Java but stopped. Later started with Python and again stopped.
Wondering Why?
When you write a code, some one has to say whether it is correct. No, the compiler checks the syntax not the logic. I naively tried theoretically learning and writing code a little that compile but not logical. Slowly I gave up. (Ten years back I did not quora existed. And I can ask this same question)
Automated Testing:
Another thing I did not know was, there are sites out there, that can test the code I have written. Recently, I knew and from then on I try to enlighten as much people as possible. Testing and getting feedback from practicing to write code is more important than reading, watching courses
Okay now coming to what you asked for..
Coding is like speaking a language. A whole lot more logical and precise. When you learn such a language, one needs to practice a lot. Practicing to code is now possible in lot of online sites, like
The list provided is non-exhaustive. Free and perfect practice of Coding is already mainstream. One important point is, ability to test the code you write. The above sites, which are created by “Problem Solvers” for aspiring Problem Solvers. Your code will be tested after you provide a solution. That makes a huge difference, as I have found myself in last 3 months.
Problem Subset…
When you think your code will solve a problem, it really solves a subset of the problem space. Simple example could a problem to check the maximum and minimum number in a list. Simple problem. Only that, someone might enter empty array, or enter a single number or even number without any spaces, or comma. Your code has to take care of all these subproblems.
Tester Mindset…
So testing is important. The problem solver mindset and tester mindset is two extremes. Knowing what all problems can occur in itself a problem. Tester solves it, codes it and then asks the developer to solve the problem to beat the tester’s code… (Loopy!!! True)
Coding is learnt for solving problems. By solving problems you will learn programming language faster. So start with problem solving. Have a great time learning."

There are so many places where you can get the process of training such a model. The keyword is MNIST dataset. Search for it, and you will find many blog posts and jupyter notebooks that show you how to make the hand written text recognition.
You might want to take a look at tessaract library for OCR recognition.
Courses wise, the intooduction will take a lot of time. Better prefer the books, blogs and Jupyter notebooks. One book I would suggest you to look is Deep Learning by Francois Cholet. The developer of Keras library. The book also has got companion github repo which you can use to learn.
Happy Learning."

When I attempted the coding test, I failed one of the codes. However they moved me to the next round based on the way I had attempted the problem. Their algorithm looks at how you approach the problems given. Their test cases are very exhaustive too.
Think what is required for “Passing the Coding Test”. The answer is Practice, Mastery of basic Algorithms and speed. My logic goes like this
I would suggest that, you work on many of the problems in the platform listed above. Familiarize yourself with easy to medium hard problems in leetcode, hackerrank etc. Read and execute codes from 4 to 5 books that apply algorithms to problems, using Python or your favorite language. All these or on the internet…
Then attempt the coding test in Turing. I am sure you will ace it. Even if you don’t ace it, you will radically skill up. So it is a pure Win-Win.
Spoiler Alert!!!
Keep your projects porfolio ready. After passing the Coding test, Turing will ask you to upload your project github link, or the link of the product that you have built. So their algorithm to select the candidate is foolproof.

Here is what you need to do. After that there is one or two ideas about getting job.
You have to type atleast 250 programs. Better learn a good version control software like Git or SVN so that you can keep track of these program in your computer or in the internet. That is also a easy way to reuse the code in future. None of these codes that you are going to write will be waste.
Think of it as investment that will compound faster than exponential growth.
So what can these 250 programs will be about?
Full projects here have the least count, because to implement a project, you will have to use all the other areas of programming that has been listed above. So completing a project is equal writing one or more program in other categories that has been highlighted above.
Take a look at the below visualisation.
This is visualisation of a game that we have played when we were young. We always knew one of our friends who can outsmart us, or even the entire group. Most of the time the secret is, he has read a “BooK”. What if you don’t have a book, and you want to find the best strategy to win the above game? Brute force method will be to play the game with yourself hundreds of times and find the best strategy. Boring… Repeatetive and something that computer processors are really good at.
When you program for a specific purpose, that will impact how you live, play and work in this world that will provide you constant motivation. Have a great time learning.
About getting a job:
You need to have projects that were done by you. No other way to get hold of a job. You need to have a portfolio of either projects you did in your current org or outside.
Other ways like showing the side projects you did, or having some experience with data will not take you far into the this field.
As you are learning, think about getting one or more projects done. Even for free. But get it done. You can talk fluently about the projects
All the best."

Reading is not equal to Learning
Learning is not equal to Understanding
Understanding is not equal to Skill
Skill is not equal to Mastery
However Mastery equals to GTD (Getting things done). Your answer lies in this sentence…. Mastery
Project takes in inputs in form of customers, resources, and hard work and returns a service, customer satisfaction, revenue and if the person doing the project was smart, then profit.
So programming projects are rather simple, because the project has a SMART Goal. (check google for SMART) as mentioned above. It has a function. So one first writes in plain english, how the function can be achieved by simple programmatic steps. “Programmatic Steps” is how computer works.
The programmer (you) takes the plain english sentences and think how to make it programmatic steps by referring the syntax, and vocabulary of programming language. (I think, you skipped this step). This steps takes a lot of thinking, trial and error.
Have you ever written a “message” to your crush? How many drafts it takes before you sent the message. If you don’t or didn’t have a crush, then recollect the turmoil any of your friends went through when they draft the message. Programming is not much different… When you BEGIN.
The more messages you to the computer, and get errors thrown out, we learn. Unlike our crushes(useless for learning) computers don’t get angry. They throw errors if you make mistake, and again take input from you.
Every step in the project above will have the same loop of trying, learning and re-trying. In the Beginning.
Solution:
After learning a programming language, you need to master each part of the programming language.
After doing the steps 1 and 3 some 15 to 20 times, you will get handle of the programming language. This is how genius programmers create themselves. Now you know the recipe. Have a great time learning, creating and sharing…."

I had fallen in same trap. Started learning algorithm abstractly. Then I quit. Wasted my precious ti
The algorithms are for solving problems thru coding. So here is an Algorithm to solve your challenge.
Start program.
Learn one programming language, throughly. Its syntax, vocabulary, decision making, looping… etc
There are coding exercises that involve usage of the language. Not solving puzzles, these are straight forward programming. Solve atleast 50 such problems with programming language you are learning
Then take a book on problem solving through coding, and start solving the problems by coding them. Alternatively you can use platforms like dmoj, codewars, usaco etc to do the same
Then take a book on applied algorithms. There you will learn more deeper application of algorithms.
All the above steps ensure you are coding every day atleast 5 to 8 hours.
After that have a lot of fun in life….(Once your computer is working for you can have fun. I am not kidding)

In future there will be no “job” in the sense our grand dad, our dad and we have. A bold statement… I am passionate to get machines to do the work for me. Being a Mechanical Engineer, love for machines is a given…
We are talking about Data Science and Machine learning, where machines do the work. So think about building Machines and Tools that learn and others can use. We are in Quora Universe, we are surrounded with data. So what tool can we build?
A Live Example:
In Quora there are many who ask questions and many who write answers. Answering a question is a creative task, only humans can do it… correct? Nope, Machines are already doing it (check out open ai). Can we write a program that can help us to “Automate Answering for Questions at Quora”
Here is a recipe for anybody who has written answers to some 500 or so questions in Quora. Many questions in your domain of expertise gets repeated. Assumption is, if the questions are similar the answers to those questions will also be similar.
What if we can write a program to find similar questions, and then retrieve those questions along with their answers for a “New Question”. Here is a pseudocode for doing it…
Use pandas and numpy library to work with these columns. BTW, in this code there are libraries in which the ML models are used for finding the similarities. We only write the computer program to feed data and receive the answers.
The columns will look like this in the jupyter notebook… There are more questions, and the answers are verrrrry long. You get the idea.
Lets take your question and in the backend I have run the program and found following three questions that are similar to yours. The function “get_most_similar” returned three questions that I have already answered which are similar to the current question.
The first question returned by the program is a question that I have already answered here
If you see the answers, it speaks about various careers and it includes ML, Data Science and Robotics. Also it shows, how much I have changed my opinion about careers between Sep’21 to May’22. Yep, it is fun when you go and read your answers. (and think, did I write that!!!)
The joy of getting things done by computers is more fun, and satisfying. Especially when you can use it to speed up the spreading of your idea. Data Science and ML is supercharging this idea spread. In not so far future the “jobs” today will be obsolete. The new passion will involve lot more to do with problem solving using coding, algorithms and logic. Then the machines will do the grunt work based on your code…. (Puzzled about how will those future people, us will survive without money, or job? Will they… we need money!!!!)
Get into learning to code, solving problems and having a lot of fun… Many are doing it already."

Information revolution bought us the power computation, network connectivity and near infinite storage. It also brought us speed and ability to get things done fast and store for future. Work was digitally transferrable for the First time in Human history.
Computer programs with the interpreters and compilers have the ability to be Human Eyes and mimic Human logic. Software is meant for freeing us from mundane tasks. If you look around, has it been achieved?
Even with advent of AI we are improving fast in areas of testing, even coding and speed of data processing. Work, the repetitive work is still done by humans. Instead of pushing papers, today many click mouses, mail worksheet and PDF.
Whatever we see with eyes can be automated and made into software. Think about any calculations, optimisations, visualisations, much of sorting, searching, greedy search, dynamic programming algorithms all have the basic objective of replacing the human eyes with that of logic and program.
To answer you, there are many opportunities to start a profitable project and same time have a fulfilling life when you look at the world with new set of eyes. That is how most of the companies are created. The sales, marketingt or mostly push techniques using addiction and other manipulation to get the sales. Only good poducts have very concrete use case and the demand is always there. We have lot of examples with Google. MS and even in many technology companies are based on this concept only.
Have a great time and starting up."

Yes they are ready, but shouldn’t we train them to solve problem instead of abstracting away the complexity and messiness of the problems? Feels like a good debate topic to me. Keeping the debate aside, IMHO Kids have to be thought Problem Solving first.
Kids would be better off learning to problem solve, and code in their preferred language first. Once they tackle basic problem solving, and learn how the computer memory and processor works then the AI can be introduced.
Start with online judges like DMOJ, USACO, KATTIS where there are problems of various difficulties. Let the kids solve the entry level problems. Solve here means, that the kid comes up with the steps to find the solution to a problem. He/ she need not code it in a programming language.
If they get hooked to the problem solving, and abstract the many algorithmic concepts then AI can be introduced. AI is type of problem solving, and many kids do use AI today in competitive programming contests. Not all problems need AI. This is the hard truth. Most of the problems can be efficiently solved by using the “Big Brains” given to us humans."

If one wants to prove that is his NFT, he has to register that piece of screen shot on a blockchain like Open Sea or other hosting chains. For that registration one has to pay in crypto coins. That costs money.
Whether it is a loop hole depends on how much one spends, to register that piece of screen shot. Higher the cost to register, lesser you will want to copy someone’s screen shot. If you are putting your own money, then why not create your own art. In this way, loop hole that you are thinking is circumvented.
At the same time, some who go ahead copying the screen shot without thinking and register it in blockchain to realize there is no way to get their money back, except to sell their NFT, they start marketing the nft. In order to market, you have to spend “time”. Which is costlier than money.
So there again, the loop of NFT is closed. In long run only those legitimate NFTs will be there. Rest will slowly fade into obscurity."

Step 1, Start by learning the syntax of the programming language of your choice “the hard way”. That is by typing the example problems.
Step 2, Solve a lot of problems using code and get it tested on multiple inputs. You can use online judges, and their own problems if you are experienced in solving problems.
Step 3, Learn new algorithms and data structures and see if your old solutions can be modified
Step 4, Bring in Object Orient programming and learn new way of thinking about the problems
Step 5, Learn about the ML machinery, libraries, their implementation in detail. Try a lot of problems
(I am unable to share the links of resources on quora, since it is considered as promoting these tools, so please search with the keywords, that are marked with “keyword”)
Machine learning is just a machinery, like shredder in office. Your code will take the data to the Machinery and process the data. You have to aim at coding the machinery itself, if necessary “from Scratch”. Search for coding “Data science from Scratch”. You will find very interesting material and books. Steadily develop your understanding of the ML machinery.
Start with the Why? in the Mind. Prefer to master anything that you start learning, for being in the flow and achieve happiness. The world might be in chaos, but when you sit in your bunk and start typing that calmness spreads. That is result of mastering. Have the same objective in mind.
But How? Coding mastery can be achieved by learning to solve problems with coding. Solve easy problems with coding first, and then solve increasingly tougher problems. I have written the same formula in many other answers, that is the proven solution. Search for “Programming Challenges, Online Judges, Competitive programming” and you will find interesting materials in the internet. Feast on them.
There is nothing competitive about Competitive programming. Every solution till date is shared and the competitors themselves want many others to learn problem solving. They get that feeling of calmness and happiness when they code and solve problems. (Glory and fame is major motivator, but cannot be sustained for long lasting mastery). They are spreading their love for CP with the tools, online judges, websites, books and lot of free resources. Use them, and importantly share them with coming generation.
Have a great time."
41,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-source-to-learn-design-and-analysis-of-algorithm/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,57,–,www.quora.com,What-is-a-good-source-to-learn-design-and-analysis-of-algorithm,"The good source to learn design and analysis of algorithms… is by solving Problems.
The Problem:
Lets take a simple problem. You are given a list that contain email addresses, and you need to clean it. This is standard requirement in many companies where the email address recieved from surveys, online campaigns, and marketing activities. The email addresses needs to follow the industry standard.
The Solution:
Looks simple, so you write the code in python using the lists and string manipulation functions. When your email address is cleaned, you want to add it to a list for later use. You want to avoid duplicates, so you “Check” if the email_address is already in list before appending it. Like below
“”“ If address not in address_list:
address_list.append(address) “””
The Analysis:
This is where the analysis kicks into gear. The “in” keyword checks every element in the list before returning True/ False to the program. If there are 100K addresses, every time it checks all the 100K address.
The complexity of this search is O(n X m). Where n is number of address in list and m is the new addresses being added to the list. This means the work or steps taken by the algorithm for completing a task, in this case to append an e-mail address. If there are 100K address in list, and another 100K to be added then you see how the work increases for the processor.
The Solution:
The solution is simply using the Set() instead of using List(). Set() searches in O(1) time, near instantaneous, since that is how that data structure is built.
As I already explained, the problem had to be solved first. Then when the problem is slow the analysis for new and faster solution is undertaken. In order to learn, start solving problem. (This solution I learnt from a book and wanted would be problem solvers to know)
The Procrastination:
I had been procrastination the training on Problem solving for more than 12 months. I was confident that learning the Data Science, Visualisation, Web Scraping, Data base and Data Wrangling libraries, I can solve the problems. It did not work out that way. When I think about the problem solving, even open the problem webpage in front of me, butterflies started flying in my stomach. On top of that, I had a feeling that, I am smart enough and seen enough courses so I don’t need to show to the world that I can solve it…. How wrong I was….
Game It:
Push yourself out of this procrastination. Take some books on “problems solving through coding” (search for this sentence) and start working on that book chapters and exercises. You will be astonished how interesting the world of problem solving can be. It is like playing video games with puzzles. The more you play, better you will become. There are many online judges that can test your code and provide feedback.
Pro and Con of Videos
Letting others solve your problem of (Learning problem solving, algorithm design and Data structures) by watching them will help only 10 to 30%. It can provide
After that the Cons start.
Take the book, or go to the problem hosting website and start solving. Have a great time. It is a wonderful world."

Just give it a search you will find. Once you read it, then realize. Ooh Data Science is about coding, problem solving and Math. Not just libraries and jargons."
44,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-learning-or-strengthen-my-knowledge-of-data-structures-and-algorithms/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,28,–,www.quora.com,How-do-I-start-learning-or-strengthen-my-knowledge-of-data-structures-and-algorithms,"Why you want to strengthen algorithms? To solve problems. Period.
You strengthen your knowledge by solving the problems of increasing complexity with constant practice. Key to practice is Testing and Feed Back. Not reading. In fact you should not read at all. Reading is like consuming fast food. Reading this answer too is waste of your time. (Now that you started reading, read on there is some interesting pointers that will help you move forward and be worth your time.)
In this time you be solving one problem, trying to implement and test it. You would have learnt something more interesting about the problem. Best problem solvers, chess players, game masters, Go players all do just that, sit and solve.
There are countless books that explain the datastructures and algorithms.In
reality many problems don't need complex algorithms. Even the algorithm developers first find the solution, then if the solution is slow then they move to a different faster algorithms. A programmer, or problem solver need not worry about what options are there until he has solved the problem.
Where to find problems that are curated according to the difficulty level?
There is USACO, then DMoJ both of which I am finding very approachable, even though I come from non-computer science back ground. Codeforces, Hackerrank, leetcode too or some good platforms. These platforms have online free courses which provides deep knowledge about the various aspects of problem solving, algorithm development and Data structures. They too insist on Solving Problems and in parallel learn more new stuff. Irony eh.
When you are coding software, there might be no constraint on speed or about efficiency. In Competetive programming, Data Science and engineering the speed and efficiency becomes very important. Because large datasets are parsed through. When a million rows moves in and out of a model, keeping the execution of your function in seconds will make the overall program run for the whole day. We think computers are fast. But they have to work. Work takes time. I have done such mistakes and then realized the amount of computation that was wasted.
So open the IDE, and get coding. Get some mileage in solving problems. Make some mistakes, correct them. Laugh at yourself. If you attempt 100 problems, you might solve 70 or 50 and pass all tests, thats fine. Solve. Like Alec Baldwin says keep on closing, our magic words or “Keep on Solving”.
Once you get some mileage then read solutions to the problems other coders have come up with. Many of these sites have the solutions to past contests. Solve the contest problem yourself “and then” read the other programmers solution and implementation.
Solving… Reading Code and again Solving. You will then start seeing patterns. And then learn. Like a kid falling, getting up and then running. That is when the books on algorithms and DS makes sense.
The concepts will mean nothing if you don't experience the pain being stuck in a problem, or taking a longer solution, coding it and then finding there is simpler datastructure. (This happens in real life many times, for us to realise the error)
Your memory becomes stronger with such a practice and revelation. All the best solving problems, and come post your experience after your adventure with solving problems."

When it is engaged there is no wiggle room. So the driver can intuitively know the vehicle is “in“ gear as it is said.
This is important when a new driver starts the vehicle. If the gear is not checked and if the vehicle is started, the vehicle jumps forward. This hurts the battery and the engine. Also it shows the driver is an L-Board(never tail an L board even if she is miss universe, you will meet with an accident).

Code should flow from your fingers the moment you feel that you understand a problem. I have been proponent of Mastery and being in Zen like Flow. Meditation and Problem Solving are two places out of many, where you can be in such a state of flow.
There are two ways of solving the problem, one is using the closed form equation(Wave Equation for example), and another is using Algorithmic process(Gradient Descent that is used extensively). When you solve real world problems, it is always using Algorithms. We might use closed form equations in some steps.
Take simple physics problems and try coding them, plotting the equations. Use Sympy library, along with Matplotlib. Start playing around with python visualisation, and sympy algebraic solvers. There are couple of books that talk of simulating physics, math and real world problem with python (search for them in google, here I am unable to share). Solve the exercise in those books. (I am a mechanical engineer by training, and it is exhilarating feeling to see the problems getting solved and test cases pass)
The business problems out there need multiple conditions to be checked, and finally decisions to be made. So the main objective of Data Science is to solve countless problems and find these conditions. That too repetitively, at high speed and using available resources. Coding is the only way."

Whether to categorize a data as positive or negative like Spam or Not Spam. Or to divide the given data into arbitrary categories like identifying the part of essay.
The objective of the ML is not the “Correct Answer”, that is accuracy. Objective of ML is to “Fit” the model close enough. (If there was a way to get the correct answer, using closed form equations is better than ML. This is one of the reasons, why I started learning problem solving and competitive coding on online judges platform. It helps you reason logically about the answer provided by the ML model. Most of the times, you have to use additional problem solving on top of ML.)
Take the following example. ML model will create an equation, which tries to catch as much correct answers as possible in the given dataset. Lets take a small visualisation exercise…
The equation is in the order of power 5, and the curve it traces is very non-linear. We can intuitively say that, most of the training data has been fitted perfectly by the model. (Model will have low bias, high variance). That is overfitting.
The test data will not fit in the pattern defined by the equation. So the testing accuracy reduces drastically, compared to training accuracy. In terms of lay man, the model is not generalizing for the natural data that is created. In these cases, it is better to refer Recall and Precision, rather than using accuracy.
Recall measures what fraction of True Positives the model predicts correctly(Tp /Tp + Fn). Precision measures how accurate the positive predictions are(Tp/ Tp + Fp). That by itself says a lot about the model that is trained.
When your model is being trained, it is given a error or loss function which it needs to minimize. The lesser the error, better the fit. Model continues reducing the loss every epoch, and after a particular level of loss, the accuracy of the test data starts reducing while training data accuracy is increasing. Which means, as the model is training it is overfitting the data.
There are some solutions for this condition.
The objective of the ML as highlighted already is not correct answer, but to find insights into the data. To explain how certain features have effect on the final outcome. Like in doing Real Science Experiments. Some of these experiments can lead to laws like Newton’s laws of physics, and other will lead to models like the weather prediction models that we have today."

You will understand how life changing it can be. You will know everything about the logic, the syntax will be correct, the code you have typed will be prefect and yet two or three test cases fail.
Hours together is spent to not solve the problem but to learn the problem and take care of every mode of failure that you program can undergo. When you spend that muh time and get the solution correct, means the solution will for sure work in real world. That is how real world excellent programs are written. Excellent programmers can become good leaders, solely for their logical thinking and their thoroughness.
Many who intuitively solve the problem think such level of detail is unwanted. when their solution fails in real world they blame the nature or others.Seldom do they hold themselves responsible. They loose their credibility, get demoted and even loose their jobs.
I have been one of those intuitive thinkers. Now with training in programming I realise how important is Logic along with knowledge about the world and the subject. In fact the subject knowledge is useful to test the program than actually programming. Only the expert can come up with extremely rare test cases because he experienced it. But by persevering with the problem, the programmer can imagine test cases that might create problem and work for the same much before the problem happens.
We are programming in real life at many places. At our work, in our kitchen, with our family and friends. Most of the time we struggle because we missed one important point that comes and haunts us back. With programming, you will force yourself to slowdown. Think through the problem inside out. Those who think logically in these these places will progress faster and more easily.
There are downsides too but they are not logically valid downsides. Like overthinking, laziness and unwanted negative biases. These are there whether you one thinks through the problem or not. Problem solving is more profitable than thinking that solving the problem might lead to new problems. (You see illogic in our biases and negative thinking)
When you ask the question, whether it is Logical? Then your brain automatically compartmentalises the problems that you have and the problem you are working on. Have a great time gaining problem solving skills."

Math in ML is not that difficult, and there is no fixed quantity of math that needs to be mastered. Lets take the basic ML algorithm, Linear Regression.
The model created by regression algorithm will be like below equation. Only 2 dimensions are considered. In ML, this dimension goes in range of 10s to even 100s. The idea will remain same. The equation itself can be shown using Python’s Sympy library.
Now for what value of ‘x’ the above model(equation) will have minimum output?
Sympy library can help to plot the graph for us visualise
We can see the there is local minimum values and a global minimum value. One of the algorithm to find these values is Gradient Descent. Linear regression uses gradient descent algorithm to find the value of X so that the loss is minimum. It is called “minimizing the loss”.
Example of visualisation in 3D space. The equation to generate this curve is simple.
Much of the ML and AI models do this “Loss Reduction” at various levels of complexity, in multiple dimensions.. GD algorithm is explained in school level Algebra. You can even implement that in python in simple way once you understand the steps required. This level of math is pre-requisite to those interested in Machine Learning.
Why am I telling this?
When you go into uncharted territory, you better know to use the tools at your disposal. Know them inside out. Math is Swiss Army knife in the forest of AI and ML. Knife is sharp and looks dangerous however we have to learn by using it.
First we cut soft fruits like mango and apple, then move to more hard fruits like water melon and even coconut.
Same way, we have to learn the Math through the visualisation, and theory to effectively master ML and its algorithm. Let the higher levels of Math be abstracted by the scientists, but at the usage level Math needs to be learnt.
Back to GD. Gradient descent algorithm finds the global minimum of the loss function. In order to use ML, we don’t need to know how GD algorithm is implement. The ML libraries abstract that and give us an interface or API to get solution. When the solution is calculated the math knowledge can support in checking if the solution makes sense.
If there is any doubt whether Math can be mastered, then start with simple problems and solve them. There is Project Euler, a platform where you can attempt simple to very complex math problems. There are many online competitive programming judges that provide you challenges and you can write program. The online testing platform will help to check your code."

To us, who are newly entering the world of problem solving, software engineering and coding this secret is vey very important.
The Secret
One has to read a lot of solutions to many different problems. (Read on, before you decide to use this strategy)
Lets take the world’s top coder, and how he would have started solving problems at very young age. Whatever his level of genius might be, he has to still look at the answer to know whether he solved the problem correctly. This means, the top coders started reading the solutions, AFTER SOLVING THE PROBLEMS themselves before long time. Here is a ROAD MAP one such Genius coder’s evolution.
Zero Problems Solved:
Our yet to be Genius coder lets call him Top Coder, is last in the line thinking about climbing the ladder of problem solving, competitive programming. The usual process is to take different courses like Data Structures, Programming Language and even problem solving before the first problem is solved. This is fine for learning the programming language at the surface level. Top coder aces it within 2 weeks, by practicing the simple problems provided by the introductory book on the programming language.
50 Problems Solved:
The process continues, top coder solves the problems. No choice. But as a noob, it is very important he practices with simplest problems, and gain confidence. Once he starts gaining confidence more challenging problems are taken up. This is where most of the would be TOP CODERS drop off. Our Top Coder is not one of these dropouts. He regularly bunks work or school to solve the problems. Even at school / work he is thinking about the problem. He has the list of problems he wants to solve with him always… That is his level of determination…
51st problem being attempted
The problem chosen can be very high in complexity or it might need new concept that a layman cannot find out through trial error. When this happens, our Top Coder as beginner looks at the solution and learns from it. He then searches for similar problems, and applies the learning with slight variations.
He learns to come up with good test cases and starts sharpening his solutions so all the test cases are passing. Modular programming becomes his mantra. The notepads are filled up, and new refill pens are purchased. The next couple of problems might be partially solved, and other problems can be a road block and doesn’t allow him to progress. He pushes on forward and onwards
75 Solutions read : 60 problems solved:
This is the situation where learning curve of Top Coder is becoming steeper. Brain which is untrained till date, gets chance to make some new connections. The problems solved increases at slower rate. Top coder has already finished 3 books on various problem solving techniques, and another 6 or 8 is left. The time he spends on solving the problems increases from 30 ~ 60 mins to 3 hours. The days start flying without any break or his knowledge.
150 solutions read : 100 problems solved: (Re Solve with different Programming Language)
That is a milestone in Top Coder journey of becoming The Problem Solver. He has solved 100 problems all by himself, and he has read additional 50 problem’s solution. Now he “Re - Solves” some random problems that he had read the solutions in the past, as well as those problems that he solved himself. The top coder does this by learning a different programming language and hones his skills. He gets 2 things done with one activity. Efficient
150 Problems solved : Algorithm design & Efficiencies:
Over 250 to 300 solutions has been read and understood. Many of the notes taken is safely tucked in his repo or some note keeping software. Notes are ready for him to search. Now the problems are complex enough that multiple problems needs to be solved in certain sequence to achieve the results. More like chaining. This is when the design of new algorithms comes in. Efficiency in programming is the time taken by the program to run. The pros call it Big O notation. Top Coder learns about it at this stage, and even find algorithms that have better efficiencies.
Intermediate and Beyond:
More than 450 problems, read, understood and solved. Our Top Coder is at the intermediate levels. More like getting “Blue Belt” in Karate terms. Black Belt needs more training, additional practice and lot more involvement in finding solutions. Here on there will be NO READING THE SOLUTION AT ANY COST. This constraint will push the limits of Top Coder’s capabilities. He understands himself, and starts solving problems in his own style.
500 to 600 Problems solved:
Let us imagine for a moment you are that Top Coder, and you are at this stage. How will you feel? What will be your confidence level. What kind of challenges you might take up next? This has to be the goal of the Top Problem solver. It is a journey that has end only when your consciousness stops to exist. Enjoy every step of the journey. See you on the other side."

Data Science starts with Data, and that data comes from the web. On web there are many services,online platforms, social networks and companies that bring people together. These people generate data by interacting, and creating.
The Science and Target area
Data science is science of these interactions, and the modeling of them to predict the future. This is where web crawling comes into picture. There are established algorithms that can be used to crawl the web and get the links of interest. After that the page under the link needs to be soraped. We will simply try to get the links of our interests by first targetting a site or domain.
Scraping and parsing
To scrape, the most common libraries ar Selenium, Beautiful soup, Requests and PhantomJS. There are specific parsers neceseeary to get the data in the form the next libraries can use. Notable parsers are, libxml, htmlparsers.
Traversing the Tree
The webpage is a tree with data at the leaf. The page has many tags and these tags have attributes. Xpath is preferred framework to traverse this tree and get the data. The browsers offer this xpath traversing option in the settings. Selenium, and BS support Xpath.
Storing the data
Dataset and SQLite library are very useful when it comes to storing the data to sql databases. The data is stored datatbase files, so they can serialized and stored on harddisks.
Doing Science
We have the data. After that, we can use libraries like Pandas and Numpy to clean the data for modeling. The science and analysis starts earlier as explained above.
Each step has its own problems, libraries that solve it and unique skillset. Skill that is required at all steps is imagination , and problem solving. If these two are mastered, then programming languages and its libraries will take care of the rest"
64,https://www.quora.com/Can-I-become-an-AI-expert-with-online-learning/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,32,–,www.quora.com,Can-I-become-an-AI-expert-with-online-learning,"Yes, you can become an expert at AI if you “learn” the following, irrespective of Online or Offline.
As you see, there is no AI involved to become in expert in AI. AI is a discipline that has been rapidly spreading because it is easy to get hold of data and computing power. Lets take a problem.
The above image is simplest image recognition problem. You give this image to a AI model and ask whether the line is going up or going down? AI model can be trained in such a way to find the line is first going down, and then up.
Let me share the points used in plotting the above curve (0,5), (1,1), (0,2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 5), (10,6)…
How will humans be able find whether the above points are going up / going down / going up and then down or the going down and then up?
Human has no figure, only the set of points. Think for a moment If you want computer to solve, then we should solve first, and the write a program to instruct computer on the solving process.
In order to become expert in AI and not just be one in a million, you need to really understand how the computer works with the data, mathematics, and problem solving. Unlike what many of the online classes are (Andrew Ng’s Youtube Videos and Joel Grus book are exeception) directly jumping into solving the problem using ML / AI models after courtesy introduction about the mathematics and computers. By following that, you can learn to use the data, feed the data to the sophisticated libraries and make final reports. You can still do Data science with Online Courses.
If you are thinking about becoming expert then you have to dive deeper into machinery involved in creating these libraries, and the underlying Math that makes the machinery run. There are resources, good problem solving training books, and very approachable books on mastering programming languages. The key is, the code in these books have to be understood, typed and then executed by yourself. You have to hack the code, and try breaking it to understand.
I started with the naive idea that learning Data Science is simple, and can be mastered with 3 months. Yes, I mastered the libraries. Joined online competition to solve the challenges in Data Science. Then it dawned on me, that it is about programming, mathematics and proficiency in problem solving. Every step of data science, you solve problems. Whether it is visualisation, model generation, model deployment or reporting. (I did not touch about model explainability, that is another interesting area)
Solid Time commitment is required for master the Data Science Machinery and underlying Math. Time allocated for reading problems, solving problems and then writing code has to be the highest. You can learn new concepts and immediately take some real problems and solve it. If not create a fictional one with data and solve it.
Have a great climb to expert level in AI. It is a worthy pursuit. All the very best."

Depending on your age, and level of maturity the content will either enlighten you, or make you confused.
It is not strange that there is no answer for this question.
The solution to your issue is simple. Masturbate. It is acceptable to Masturbate (With love and care and ensure no damage occurs)
When you are horny, either Testosterone or Estrogen, depending on your gender, are at high levels. These harmones reek havoc in your brain to such extent that, logical thinking collapses on its own weight. The imagery of having intercourse spontaneously gets created. The body starts feeling entirely strange. Voices of your loved ones, and their images flicker past your mind’s eye… Yep, all are the makings of these harmones….
The moment you release the “Rogue Harmones” from the body then the horny-ness vanishes. There goes the science of it. Now for some important things, which are non-sciency.
Depending on your age, the food you had, the people you have spoke with, things you have read and seen, everything affects the harmones that cause you to be horny. So try to learn about your body. Try to enjoy the act. Ensure you are not creating any skin damage in the process.
There are many religious and cultural taboos against Masturbation because, if you flog then you will not want to marry and have kids. If there are no kids then the religion or the culture will die. Be cautious about your belief systems. They are usually illogical.
Will my energy reduce?
There is no link between masturbation and how energetic you are. There are many movies, and books written about celebate priests or monks who abstain from the very act of human nature. None of these high priests or so called heroes discuss about their manly activity in the stories.
Will you become a Homo or Lesbian?
You can become a pro-wrestler or Pro-Pickup artist. It is in your hand. The human body and brains are wired in complicated ways, and this wiring can change as you age. You will still like to be with your opposite sex, have the urge to win, take responsibility and have a great life. More over, your partner will have confidence that, you are “Clean” when he are she comes close to you.
The advantages are really overwhelming. And there is no downside, except that your DNA is being wasted. For females the nature itself removes their egg every 28 days. For men as we are opposite to females, the release is in your own “Hands”. Have a great life ahead."

If you want the Machine to learn, then only way is through math.

All these libraries(Bento ML, Pycaret, SciKit Learn, Numpy, Pandas, StatsModel….) will give you garbage out, if you enter garbage in….
Yep. There is no short cut. Learning Math, and Logic is mandatory. However, math or Logic is not difficult if you learn from correct book or teacher with mindset to learn. Lets assume you did not listen to this advice and opened a apparel shop.
IN-SHOP APPAREL RECOMMENDER SYSTEM:
Your shop is prime location, and has good deal of customers around your locality. The customers are in few hundreds, lets assume. You want the shop to be futuristic, and have only limited man power(You believe humans have to design the apparels, and not stand in store waiting for customers). Based on customer past purchases you can do 3 things.
THE PROBLEM
How to build such a recommendation system with your shop’s customer data?
You decide to purchase a recommender system. The recommender system that you purchased has just the basic functionality. There is a python library called Surprise, that can be used after learning from data and recommend. The recommender system just takes the data into the Library, then it gets ready to recommend apparels to your customer. You are surprised!!!
In your store, you have a camera which is used to identify the customer who has entered the store (Deep learning Computer vision model) and then automatically triggers the recommender program. On the wall there is a display which shows and vocalizes
“”” Welcome Back <Customer Name> ^_^”””
and then proceeds to recommend some of the apparels the customer might like, on the store display. Customer is surprised to be welcomed by SHOP and even to be suggested apparels!!!. Customer starts walking around the shop, and browses the materials. Lets assume for fun, the customer is a pregnant women and she is looking for some loose fitting cloth. Her age is 28. Now the joke starts…
The Shop display starts showing some tight jeans, and skinny T shirts that are trendy among the 28 year young females. The recommender system that is developed without the knowledge of Maths / Coding, and how to incorporate new information into the data, cannot consider the fact that the customer is “PREGNANT”. Recommender system cannot logically find that pregnant women cannot use tight jeans. Recommendation fails!!! Customer leaves your SHOP, ANGRY and Nostalgic about her care free days… Not a pretty outcome.
“””This case of wrong recommendations continues with new variants for another 10 customers”””
By that time, you realize the recommender system is junk because is not getting the data to recommend accurately. So, you decide learn about the data inside it and how it works. The code for the recommender system is directly downloaded from the product website. So you visit the website. There you find their code repository open for the users to review, modify and learn…. (This is the future, so get ready)
The LOGIC Correction
The code is written in languages that are popular for such systems, Python, R and frontend is written in Javascript and HTML Libraries. When you read the code, you realize the level of math that is being used is rather basic. There are clear comments about why some function is being called, and what is the logic behind the function. Bit more complicated functions are directly imported from the libraries elsewhere in the internet. The more you read the code, you start getting idea how to improve your recommender system. (Here you realize the impact of math and logic)
Your WITTY RECOMMENDER
After some 10 hours of working, you have coded some additional logic into the recommender system and sent it to the code reviewer to check it. The reviewer finds some issues and suggests to edit the logic. Another 5 hours or so this goes back and forth and finally your recommender system is ready. When you deploy the system, based on your shop’s customer the recommender works and the customers are kept engaged, and delighted. You even made your recommender witty, by making it to tell jokes about the recommender systems that suggest tight jeans for pregnant ladies….
So math is very important, and understanding libraries at a deeper logic level will give you more power, and creativity. There are couple of books that introduces doing math with programming language. Search “Doing Math with Python / R/ Javascript” in Google, you will find countless books. Learn the concepts, and understand how to program math to computers. The code in the books that you choose, needs to be typed by yourself and executed to understand. Then you can fluently learn about the libraries that do the real Machine learning.
Have a great time learning. Reachout to google, stackexchange or here for clarifying and researching your doubts."

NN does the modelling of your networks differently.
Neural nets can help you to analyse the data in many dimension, even the dimension your “gut feeling” will consider and your brain cannot. Our brain is strictly rooted in the present 3D world. It is difficult for it to visualise higher dimensions and try categorising things as per these dimensions. Try thinking of a problem that is time and space dependent, it becomes very difficult visualise without practice.
For example, If I ask you, why you like people with green eyes, or face with a particular shape or voice of particular pitch for that matter(Remember that irritating voice that makes you angry or restless). Your brain cannot answer, since there is no numerical rating for these characteristics. Brain cannot create a model. But neural nets can take these into account and model your social networks. I am only scratching the surface of what can be done.
There are other simple math relations you can find using Network Analysis. Here neural nets are not involved.
I had the same question that you asked before 12 months, and I started learning neural nets very deeply. Recent advances in Neural nets are very fascinating. If you don't understand, then it will feel like magic. There are huge libraries of programs that support modelling the social networks and other kind of networks. Please research and learn about it."

There is really no need for Machine learning. You can program the camera module for example, a surface scratch defect. The module will work flawlessly, and detect only some kind of scratches.
If some new defect arises, then the whole process needs to done and camera module reprogrammed. This can be avoided.
Where Machine learning can excel is in applications where we humans know some thing is defective, but programming it is cumbersome and repetitive. Machine Learning, literally automates such repetetive programming. The variant is neural network called Convulutional NN that excel at learnin such defects and successfully classify the new defects.
There are many deep NN that can differentiate, dogs from cats and even differentiate dog breeds. So the defects are like that only. The more training samples you have better the training and validation accuracy will be. The ML solutions can speed up the basic classification, and instead of using more manpower, one operator can do the final checkin of the defect.
I have not even scratched the surface of ML. It is just a no theory intro of ML.

When you are from testing background you will catch many of the libraries and algorithms very easily. So, Go ahead learn DS. But learn on your own, with intention to skill up. Not to change career.
Why not change carrier? Let me convince you that, your own domain has more opportunity, if you look.
You can learn DS and then look at your domain problems. The more you look in any domain there are areas where data is generated. Say, you want to know how many tests you are currently running. That depends on the number of projects, resources under you, and their profeciency. You must have a dashboard showing that.
There are just three dimensions. What can you do to increase the speed of your tests? Hmm, that needs analysis. You might find that relationship between profeciency and speed is less, but with increased number of resources the speed is more. How you prove this? Data Science.
There could be countless locations where inefficiencies will be there in your organisation. You can collect data, analyse and show these areas. Once you do that, you will realise that you are able to lead better, convince people easily and get things done fast. No wonder you will start liking what you are doing. This happens not just at work, but at home too.
Learn data science and use the skill to contribute. If good opportunity comes use it. Shifting job alone cannot be a good motivator. Have a wonderful career."

Here is what you can do…. You have to complete 4 books and master the way of programming, documenting, testing and deploying. Once you complete and get confident, please share it with your friends or family members so they too can learn programming. Programming is an important skill in this complicated world. Lets dive in…
>> You will have to learn about to Jupyter notebooks, Regular Expressions and get introduced to SQL, HTML etc in coming steps. So the learning curve will be steep. Like KTM Duke / Yamaha RX 100 accelerating…
>> Test driven development is same as In-process quality testing in Mechanical Industry. (I am from manufacturing and mechanical background) If you remember the assembly lines where operators can stop the lines if there is defect. Software industry uses that idea efficiently and built lot of libraries around it. You will catch it very easily.
4. Lets level up a bit. Search for books that provide programming challenges that are more about problem solving through coding. Here too select a book which introduces you to problems that are easy to start, and slowly builds up challenge.
5. Solve the problem, Code the challenges, and then upload the code file to GitHub.
The above steps can take anywhere between 30 days to 90 days depending on your speed of understanding, problem solving and typing speed. I am considering that you are interested in sitting with the laptop all day long (14 to 16 hours). If you are working, then give additional 3 months time to master these steps.
These steps helps you to
Once you equip with these skills, you will understand many things that happen in the Software Industry. Also, you can confidently choose any software project you want, and approach it with confidence, and clarity that you will complete it.
Yeah, getting the job interview might be still tough, but after learning the above skills, you might even decide to go freelancing, or approach the job hunting differently. All the very best."

ML can work only on data that is fed. It cannot create new data or experiment. Some flavours of Reinforced learning can do experiments and learn, it is still not methodical experimentation. Allow me to elaborate.
Causal relationships are like laws of this universe. Starting from newtons laws of motion, Laws of thermodynamics, Energy conservation laws.
We have an age old wisdom that is,
Correlation does not imply Causation.
To imply Causation, lot of parallel study in unrelated feilds will be required. The physical experiments, the theory behind the causation needs to be verified mathematically. Many such discoveries yeild noble prize. We should also remember the creativity and meticulous work of scientists in finding such causation. Even then, many findings in the past were just correlation.
Machine Learning is purely mathematical. The universe it works is very different from our reality. The number of dimensions in some ML problems can go in hundreds of dimensions. But they are conceptual dimensions. Not something you can physically see or feel.
With help of libraries written in programming languages that can handle huge data, the theory behind the Machine learning is abstracted. Thanks to object oriented programming, it is much easier to abstract the machinery. If not today ML will be in obscurity.
With machine learning a new law or causation cannot be discovered, but only learned. The causation will be learnt using equations, variables and their outputs. They cannot be proved using more mathematics. But the outputs will have sufficient accuracy so we can make decision or influence someone."

Before there was Statistics. Statistics is very misleading when the data is not sufficient. You have countless books explaining how statistics can be misleading. AI and DS leverages on Statistics, and solves problems and does it so well. But do we need it??? You will find out, keep reading
If you need one skill to then it is Problem Solving. There are many aspects to problem solving.
AI and DS started flourishing because the data availability sky rocketed along with the Computational power. Consider the datapoint.
How can these 5 points determine whether the company will default on the loan? In past, there will be no way to find out, apart from lot of calculation, years of experience and finally taking risk and extending credit. Finally see if the company repays it. That was a problem to banks. Today, the problem is solved (atleast 97%), to an extent that it is possible to predict the default ahead of time.
The Key is PREDICT. AI and DS are used extensively to predict the outcomes. They are used to locate the correlations, that our naked eyes or paper pencil calculations cannot show. All you need is the creativity and intuition to predict what might happen next.
Programming, Math are just tools. If you can predict or if your intuition says something will happen, then you use programming to collect the data and math to work on the data to PROVE you are correct. This is a very powerful ability. Leaders and effective managers use data so skillfully to influence the world around them.
Visualise yourself sitting in a meeting with a potential partner, and he is sharing you the benefits of a investment Scheme. As he continues to explain, your intuition says is there some flaw in the investment opportunity. You are unable to find it out. What you do next? Go to Google and ask for reviews from other users, or directly ask for the pro and cons of the investment scheme. Here you are trying to predict what will happen if you choose the scheme. You solved the problem, correct?
If you want others also to solve the problem, or if you want to solve the same problem with different values, conditions, and time lines then you can automate the process by programming it. The steps you take manually can be programmed simply using any programming language, say python and execute the below PSEUDOCODE.
Each step above needs many steps, and many problems to solve. You have to imagine what you need as end result and walk back towards the current situation. Many things like programming, libraries, databases knowledge might be required, or you can hire someone to do it for you. Again, you can solve the problem that you have.
It is acceptable to be unaware of something and be weak in it. It is unacceptable to be weak after you know how to master a skill. All it takes to learn problem solving and programming is the passion to solve problems and create change in your own life and that of others.
There are so many free resources that is offered by many online Problem solving websites, that you can learn from. Many programming languages can be compiled on the websites. The data is available freely if you search in in Google. Change your mindset and start solving problems. Solve easy ones and gain confidence, then move to difficult ones. There are books which curate problems from easy to difficult levels. Search for them, and you will get it.
Have a great life and wonderful time learning to solve problems."

If you get to AGI,then you may have to let the AGI run your company… Hmm, interesting situation, rite? Think about it. Musk is alread fighting that such level of AI should not be created. Musk is a physics major too.
An AGI has to be connected with multiple AGI in order to show emergent behaviour. Then only AGI can become conscious. Because physicists have proved consciousness is a cause of an emergent system, our brain.

Think this way. when a simulated world grows to level were that world can create its own simulation, then Recursion happens. Godel has written a lot on this idea. Take a look at his writings. Trippy, yet very gripping
With the advent of quantum computing, finding the matters that are why smaller that, a huge collider is required, the march towards metaverse, all these tech can help in creating a man made simulation. Which means, simulation inside the simulation. Recurrsion.
You must be aware of recurssion in programming, that is a function calling itself is a recursive function. If the argument given that function is very large then the system will run out of memory. If ours is a simulated world and we create a full fledged simulation, then there is possibility that our simulated beings to can create simulation. (Godel can be of help here, the math is complex). Then the main system running the program will run out of memory. And the designer of the system is lousy.
Lets assume a situation where an AI has already made paper clips out of the entire universe and a made a powerful computer to run simulations to gather data on something much bigger than this universe that this AI wants to control. Will the AI allow such recurrsion in its system, even accidentally. Will AI be a lousy programmer. Very less probability, that the null hypothesis can be safely rejected
So be assured, the world we live is not simulated. My views might change as the metaverse that many are touting really becomes simulated universe with creatures that can replicate itself by using the system resources differently, and there is a lot of “Deja vu” happening for lot more people then we might have to seriourly consider the possibility that we are just simulated beings.

When I say solutions, I need to come up with solution, code them and then find my answer is wrong. Like this 5 times if it happens, then I look at the logic. What I gain in that five times is more important.
After 5 different trials, if no correct solution then,
Here are some actions that can be taken to mitigate above challenges.
Misunderstanding the problem statement is very common. Nowadays, the online judges are having good descriptive questions, and sample cases for you to understand. So try honing your information gathering skill.
Not knowing the capabilities of the programming language, can arise due to forgetting the feature, or completely unaware of a feature. For example, in python there is a standard dict type that is part of python and default dict type that you can import from collections library.
This knowledge about defaultdict can greatly change the way you solve a problem. Start documenting the important functions, and programs and refer them regularly. Build your own Cheatsheet
Finally, solving a problems is series of decisions. When you chose a variable to be a integers, and list of integers can completely change how you access them. If your problem is designed for a list type and looping method, then doing it any other way might be tedious. Here again comes, documenting again but more detailed one.
You need full working programs to be documented. So learn Git, Github and store your programs there. Wherever you are, you must be able to get hold of the program that you want.
Most important use online judges and problems given there to train. There is still a challenge of which problems to start with. One of the judges I know have their own guide and hours of training session for free. That too online. All you need is spend time and learn.
Have a great time and all the very best."

It is the illusion created by the human mind and humans are living in illusion. For instance, in the infancy stage, humans don't have any urge to reproduce. Humans grow up without being aware of the sex hormones slowly taking over the control of their feelings and their mind. Then the uncontrollable urge causes discomfort in their bodies and in order to relieve themselves of that discomfort, the humans do the act of reproduction. Who is then driving humans to reproduce? It is the DNA residing inside the human body that is driving the body through urge to reproduce. It is the DNA that has built the body around itself for its purpose and made the body ignorant of DNA’s presence that is causing the body to think that it (i.e. the body) is controlling everything and taking action as per body’s own sweet will. Thus, the body and the mind are thinking and doing everything under illusion. So, the mind should shake off its illusion and think that it is the DNA inside it that is coercing it to reproduce and the mind should not give away easily itself to the DNA’s tantrums. Only then, the mindless reproduction will stop. In some people the DNA made errors while building their bodies and in such defective bodies, DNA is unable to cause the urge to reproduce and such people are liberated from the mindless reproduction. Remember Osho’s famous slogan, “If the child is beautiful, so is the act that produced it.”.

Yep, they do have rivals, competitors or industry threats… Google’s major products are it Search, Android OS, Youtube service and their Keyword ad services. Lets make this analysis more interesting by doing the Porter’s 5 forces analysis
New entrant threats : MAAN companies and Googles IPs will make this threat non-existent
Substitituition : Search, Youtube and Android have costlier substitutes, so the risk is low. Amazon Search can be a good substituition though.
Buyers Bargaining Power: Limited power since the algorithms at Google consider the power and price the service accordingly
Sellers Bargaining Power: Google is horizontally and vertically integrated. Their major supplier are Software engineers, Government for land, sea and electricity. The Government can be a strong Seller, with immense Bargaining Power
Industry Rivalry : Rivalry among the MAANG will not be a news those following the media, reading books about these companies. These players, are very logical and leisez faire kind of Rivals.
Some additional snippets:
As of 2017 much of the search for the theoretical and knowledge oriented products were done on Google, while the real money to businesses that makes products depend on AMAZON. Product searches are done on Amazon directly.
If any of the MAAN companies become very big, and decide to take on the core “Search” product of Google, then Google may go bankrupt.
How Challenging can taking on just the Search product can be?
Search product and its algorithms, the pagerank, keyword auction, ad display algorithms are the back bone of the Behemoth called Google.
To addon, Google has hardware network in place to take their traffic to remote corners of the world, like the T1 lines, huge numbers of data centers, companies acquired which have both computing and networking prowess.
Search is integrated in the Android phones which may come in countless flavours, but these phones use google api, services in the backend and give back the data to the Queen bee (or King bee).
When I was thinking about the everything I do in my work, there is some involvement of Google. Unlike Amzn, FB or Apple, which are just “Good to have”, not a MUST HAVE. Google is a MUST HAVE.
Will the world of Searchers be ready to pay for their Search?
Worst calamity occurs, and Google is brought down to its knees. It is unable to deliver search results or youtube videos, or other countless services. They ask for the world of “Searcher” to give/ lend/ purchase share of 1$, (or denominations of that amount). Considering only the adults in this world, who are above 15 year of age, that amount to 5.9 Billion. They will get 5.9 Billion USD in less than 24 hours, and become afloat again.
The odds of google going under and then staying under is 1 in a hunderd trillion kind. In other words it is very unlikely. So stay calm, and keep searching. (I am telling this to myself too and keep my 1$ saved for Google).
Edit in Evening:
The odds of Google going Bankrupt or taken over has increased to 1 in billion kind
There is surprising Contender for Google Search Product, and that is Open AI’s GPT3. Anyone thinking about super charging your search, then better look at that AI model. It is amazing…."

Since you are new to the corporate world, stay away from anyone you might like in office, even they may be attractive and attracted to you.
Why? Work place is not for emotional attachment. It is place of vision, execution and effeciency. All these require Logic. If you are not fully invested then your mind won't work logically and creatively. The moment you bring attachment, your brain will seize up. Instead of being attached to the vision of the team or organisation,your brain will think about the person you are attached with. Your career will slow down, and if not careful, even END.
How? How to find a mate for a date? Simplest of the option, don't Search. Be attractive enough by mind and soul, your partner will come to you. Just do what you like the most, and there you will find your partner waiting. Think about it.
Not many go to work by liking it. In workplace you will find partners who are equally distracted and disoriented. You might find them physically attractive but get bored soon after you know them.
What next? Be greatful you have a workplace and monthly salary. Think about investing in yourself and get ready for a wonderful life. Think about going to cities, mountains that are beautiful and adventurous. Make plan for your dream home, that feeling of being in control over life. Read up. Read up as many books you want on any subject. Exercise and keep your body, brain and back strong, you will need it when your partner comes in your life.
Remember, you will attract exactly the people you want and think about. Be clear who you want, how they should be, what they look like and how will they treat you. You will be surprised. when they materialise in front of you and care for you. In that moment, make sure you decide wisely and stay with that partner for life.

Key point is what question are we trying to answer, or are we searching for the Question.
When you simulate the whole world then you will get lot more questions than answer to questions that you want. There is an Open AI project that simulates multiple worlds and advices the best economic policies, search youtube for the same. That model is simple compared to modeling the entire world. And it answers a crucial question.
AI simulations of the game worlds are itself very difficult because, the agent(the AI program) has limited visibility, and the feedback for Agent’s actions is delayed for long time. This is with Starcraft, a very complex strategy game. The game company have open sourced the game engine so any body can develop on top of it on github.
IBM can combine all these together and comeup with a complicated game kind of a platform. The more it is accessible to the world of hackers and prgrammers to play and get information from it, the more it will be useful. Else it will just be a game that no one played."

First put the product designer hat and ask the repetitive tasks technicians do in their daily work. If you think there is no repetition, then look at the process they follow, and try to do process mining. Requirement gathering is done.
Take the prgrammer hat now and think how you can solve the repetition problem, and see if Computer vision, Natural Language Processing or some other AI/ solution solution may work
Then wear the coder hat, and code the solution and test it.
Software: to begin with use python libraries and tte digital data taken from the technicians. Python libraries can do a lot of activities, so explore the libraries before deciding on any propreitary software. Same goes with ML models. Many models that are trained on huge data are availabde for free.
Have a great time hacking an interesting solution."

Self Hypnosis and Reinforcement learning or completely opposite.
Self hyopnosis is a process of believing that a particular activity or behaviour can expressed by a “self”.
Reinforced learning gives positive feedback to an agent when it achieves a goal or completes an activity. If it doesn’t achieve then it is penalised. It is more akin to pleasure/ pain learning mechanism that many self help books suggest to learn a habit.
Humans learn in multiple ways, and one of them is reinforced learning. Belief system involves memory, forecasting, mirroring and mimicing, which is not fully done by Reinforced learning alone.
When Deep learning GANs and Reinforcement learning are modeled together then some level of imagination, attention can be found, but it is all mathematics. Not something equivalent to human consciousness or cognition.
Consciousness and cognition is an emergent behaviour. So is self hypnosis. If multiple agents can learn by reinforcement and communicate with each other and the environment, then self hypnosis can be modeled. But mathematically modelling it will need much research and computation power.
Have to wait and see."

I can share what I am doing now, and see if that makes sense to you.
Take up Python really serious, and learn it the hard way.
TYPE EVERY LINE OF CODE
Meaning, to do very simple to hard programming challenges by typing and executing. Because that is what a SW / ML / AI engineer does. He or she has to work with, using the language he knows with real world data, that is incomplete, messy and sometime obnoxious (quora comment, anybody!!!).
Here are some basic activities. Search for programming challenges for these activities.
BASICS:
General Variables
Input checking
Logic Flow
Functions
Repetition using loops
String Manipulation and selection
Database access and data structure usage
Web scraping and data collection
Accessing APIs
These are very basic but when you try programming with language you know, you will see that these challenges are worth it. You can search Google for “Programming Challenges”. Choose only those challenges, that help you master the language. Don’t take the “Puzzles and Problem solving challenges”. You will get easily discouraged…. That come later, you can do it now for fun!!!
REDO with GUI
After completing the programming challenges, redo these challenges by creating some of GUI for these challenges. In case of Python, TKInter or Flask is very predominant libraries to look into.
As you are familiarising yourself, you can also look for resources to “Learn Python/ Javascript/ Ruby the hard way”. Meaning, to type every line of code yourself. Then upload the code to your GITHUB repo. (You have to learn GIT, I found it intuitive)
Master Probability & Stats for Data Analysis
Another subject to master in parallel is Probability, Hypothesis and Inference in Statistics.
There are many statistical tests , data analysis heuristics that can tell you about the data, without you having to search the complete data. This is a skill which ML / AI engineers really excel at. So I am currently searching and learning these skills. Another important skill is, ability to convert your ideas into Python code. This will need practice… Typing… Executing… Repeat…
SOURCING YOUR DATA
There are lot of data sources out there. The real ML engineer can source his own data, with Style in Python. There are very good libraries in Python, but I prefer Selenium for JS enabled sites, and BeautifulSoup for regular requests site.
There is whole lot of learning, practicing, typing code, helping others to learn, typing more code, scraping most of the code when I find a simple library to do it, and the cycle repeats…
WHY DATASCIENCE IS REWARDING?
Datascience, ML Jobs are touted to be the most rewarding, because the daily tasks feels like playing games. You set yourself a particular goal, and you go after it, in REAL WORLD. Real World is messy, so you need to practice a lot to get the data from real world, make sense of it, make a model from it, and then present it as “Gold/silver/platinum level Model” to the company you work for.
Like how the “Gold Mining” was done during Wild West days, yep that is the exact analogy that suits for ML/ AI engineer too. There are many “Good Bad and Uglies” out there. The journey to get the reward is more rewarding than the reward itself.
READY FOR THE TREKKING/ MOUNTAINEERING???
So, if you are ready to take the journey (Up hill trekking/ mountain climbing) with your bare fingers typing away on the keyboard for 13 to 14 hours a day, eye burning after staring the monitor, back aching after trying to execute the code that breaks due to some silly logic errors, and much more…. then and only then START.
Once you take the 1st STEP… look up, look forward and IMAGINE and KEEP SEARCHING like a Scientist, an Engineer. We will reach… See you at the TOP"

There are many programming exercise books out there which challenge you to program everyday tasks form scratch.
The books names cannot be shared here, but you can look for the books for programming challenges. The challenges are not the difficult coding puzzles. The challenges are targeted towards familiarising the following
General Variables
input checking
Logic Flow
Functions
Repetition using loops
String Manipulation and selection
Database access and data structure usage
Web scraping and data collection
Accessing APIs
These are very basic but when you try programming with language you know, you will see that these challenges are worth it.
Spend your time doing the exercises first with only commandline method. After that create some web or GUI framework and redo the programs in that framework.

Search in Github. Then there is Dagshub that host both data and the models together.
If you are looking for some cloud service that can allow you to program the neural networks, and then get the trained model out of that service and use it in productiion, then you need to search in the internet.
I can provide you the search terms only (Providing the service names is considered as promotion in Quora) Some tems to search for are,
Cloud notebooks for python programming
Programming python on cloud servers
Neural network (Computer vision, Language) models. Also the keras library and spacy library comes with some builtin models.
Free jupyter notebooks on cloud.
These could lead you to the service that you are looking for. Have a fun time. Take as much you want, then give back once you have learnt and mastered from the internet."

Apart from that by learning to code and acouire data, you don't need to join a company, you can create your own campany. How do you think FB got created, or for that matter any of the ML companies you are aspiring to be part of?
The guys at the top have good business and coding skills, and importantly they can hack the system so they can try out their ideas fast and automated way. All this requires coding. More you can speak the Language of the Machine the more easier is to get the ML work that is rewarding.
Deep learning is much easier to learn but to code it and get the data to it for processing would be trouble if you can’t code.

In the beginning, you can use forums like Google, Stackoverflow to get support for the errors you get. In stackoverflow, you can share the complete code and ask support on the error. Pls research before asking.
For long term the solution is to read lot of good code and try to understand how it is written. Then type it out to run it yourself. Chk whether you are able to run the code succesfully. This exercise will show you new ways to debug the code. Also it will show if you are making some typo or programming syntax errors.
One tried rethod is to read the code from bottom to top, aloud. Yep, like a child learning english. You will resolve many syntax and typo errors that way.
Always type the code. Most of the time the white spaces, and tabs can create problems which propagate to many errors.
Use an IDE. This will reduce the time you spend searching the errors.
Precisely, You use the computer to help you debug. Once you can do that, then programming is fun. You can then take repetetive problems you have and try to solve them, by programming."

111,https://www.quora.com/What-is-machine-learning-with-an-example/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,64,–,www.quora.com,What-is-machine-learning-with-an-example,"Based on your series of questions regarding ML(Machine Learnin) following is a crisp answer clarifying all the areas of doubt.
ML is a process of finding realation among the variables in the data and then use that relation to predict the unknown variables in related dataset. Relation is found in Training data set, and it is validated in test dataset. Then the relation(called a model) is deployed in field.
Examples include predicting the demand of the online store, classifying a comment is toxic or good. Summarising the topic of the document using NLP. Finding the subject in a picture. All this examples have the common starting point. Numbers. Whatever the data, the machine can read numbers only. The work of ML engineer is partly to know how to convert the data into numbers.
To reiterate, whether a picture, word or general number is converted to number format the algorithms can read and provide answers. Again the answers are in Numbers. ML engineer has to feed the data in correct format and then interpret the answer that comes out of the functions.
ML engineer has to work with data that is stored in many places, like databases, documents, websites, APIs etc. They program a lot of functions that automate the data feeding and interpretation process. Then there are pipelines in production code that needs the models for real time processing. This is also done by ML engineer.
Programming Language used is Python. There are countlesss resources out there to pickup and learn this language. You must attain fluency with reading the code others have written and underrtand what it does. Later you can start writing. Try using IDE like pycharm or VScode for running the code snippets.
If you are planning to learn ML there is involvement of Mathematics. This part of ML is mostly abstracted by libraries like Scipy. Numpy, Scikit learn and importantly pycaret. So be calm and try to get some hands on in working on the data first. Slowly the math can be learnt.
Happy Learning."

ax + b = c is an age old line equation. Where a, b are the parameters. The addition of the terms on left side is the “algorithm”. There can be many complicated methods to fit the data. Also there can be many parameters, in ML they are called features.
With this simple equation, you might think, it impossible to create all this amazing results. You are correct. The idea is simple, but the work that goes into it is very intensive.
A model store the parameters, structure and the associated values. This is same for ML or deep learning model. The libraries in python for deep learning can be very confusing to begin with. Using the simple algebra equation model, you can easily understand many complex receipes.

Alpha Numerical based
Natural language based
Computer vision based
All the options will require data. So your project will spend more time on collecting data. Then you may want to annotate the data, if you are going to do supervised learning.
The domain you choose are huge currently. You can think about real world applications that are currently having ineffective solutions. Then using ML try solving it.
The industry that is ripe is Social studies and sciences. There is lot of activities that the govt takes. Recently, IT dept of India decided to open past tax returns filings based on an ML algorithm. Most probably, it is a supervised classification algorithm.
Then the engineering feild needs to be researched where the data can be used for finding good solutions. There is many opportunity in optimisation problems in production, design and reliability.
Like this, each domain has to be researched. Even the restaurants and food choices can be a ML project if you get creative.

Python and Javascript (You can learn C++ too)
Work on problem solving (Real world is full of problems, but to learn problem solving. you need to spend time with toy prblems first, theo imagin how the problems can be seen real world)
Discipline and Energetic mindset.(This is cultnvated by regularly doing things and activities that are difficult to you)
Mathematics(The language of this universe has to be learned and visualised. Spend your evenings with hot chocnate and good math book)
Lots of good Sci fiction. The ideas of many science fiction books have been made a reality. In fact AI was spoken by authors before the scentists came up with math and tech for AI.
Work on seeing the world as data. This is really an ability. The more you can think about the world as data, the more you can find interesting problems to solve. Whether a website or a mobile app, it is data. The code is also data. The infrastructure is also data.
Database and distributed computing. This will be an important technology to hold the data and process it.

I loved the way the book takes you to places that you can not imagine going to. I read 5 book from this author after that. I became a voracious Reader from that point.
The next book that pulled me was Dan Brown´s Angels and demons. Something spell binding in the way Dan uses the words to describe the places, plots, people and situation. His books transport you to a different Realm of the story.
My love for fiction was at the top when I read Sherlock Holmes by AC Doyle. ACD’s books are about the plots, the logic and the use of human brain to its peak ability. Sherlock is a person who is based on once living doctor.
Then comes the giants of Sci fi. Issac asimov, Arthur C clarke and Neal stephenson books. Their works mix, places, logic, Sci Fi know how, math, artificial intelligenc, culture and bring out a very nuanced experience that can be enjoyed only by reading them. These three authors can make you to fall in love with reading very easily.
Walter issacson has written biography of many notable founders. The probing narrative that he weaves around the lives of his subjects can bring them alive in your imagination.
Brian Tracy has some good self help books that you want to learn on self improvement. Countless Dale carnegie books too can make you read and at the same time improve.
Try the books. There is a saying that book chooses you. In that sense Robert green’s collection of books are a present as hard copies in my library. If you are ever curious about human nature then his books will give you a very in depth research which is vrey much readable.
There is Charles Dickens, Ian flemmig, Roald dahl and Rudyard kipling. Their books are introduced to children so they can get interested in reading. Try their works if yoo are inclined about enjoyable reads.

It encapsulates the entire world you live in today. The world did not change, the way information flowed, changed drastically. The population of humans increased as info flowed freely.
What to do with all this information flowing all across the world? Much of the info couldn't be stored in digital format cheaply even in late 2010. The turning point ocurred when the technology to commoditize the hard disk and processors where born.
From then the information started flowing faster and became cheaper to save. This cheaper data storage means, a lot of data which previously considered useless got saved somewhere, and that too cheaply and reliably.
Why am I telling the story of information when the question is about Machine Learning?
ML distills the informtion into actionable insights that can be used to make predictions about the future. Data analysis helps to see what the ML is doing visually. Data analysis is used for many generic tasks too, but when you use it with ML, the power to understand the ML model increases.
With all the info available, it is important that any one thinking about ML must be ready to work with lot of data and fluently move between the various data streams using the programming.
Why learning Data Structures and Algorithm is important, but not really a show stopper?
The data in real world is messy. If you want to access it,then you need to solve the problem. There comes the DS and Algo. It is not a show stopper because most of the extractions you have to do can be learned thru google, cookbooks and pair programming friends.
Being passionate about manipulating the data, thinking about using one data to find the patterns, and being eager to play with the data can hugely benefit your endeavour in to data feild. Have a great time."

Timeseries analysis of the respiration, and computer vision analysis for checking the Xray of the Lungs and Chest.
The computer vision heuristics and deep learning algo can effectively classify whether the patient is having Covid or not. The same idea is also used in detecting melanoma mutation in the Skin.
The tools are used effectively reduce the manual work involved in identifying the presence of disease using the photographs. In case of cancer the clinician has to sit on microscope and check very throughly. That takes lot of time and human energy.

Token engineering, Smart contracts programming, and Blockchain development itself.
Learning the tech is not difficult for anybody. The challenge is implementing it in a projeect or real application.
There are many options where you can learn to implement the things you learn. Ensure you have good knowledge of python, linux, server side tech, and good grasp on data structures. These are important since the industry is in transition stage, so they seek experienced people.
Not just getting certified. Even the certificate may help, but you need to have the curiosity to learn in detail about the particular area in Blockchain.

Tony stark makes it look simple to build the AI JARVIS in the movie. No sweating no learning, but lot of playing around and flying in drones. That is exactly what you need to do.
When you play video games, you will learn a lot of concepts and ideas to imagine how to solve AI challenges. The more you can visualise, and try new ideas, the solution will arise. In videogames you can try a lot of time to solve a level or stage.
You have to learn programming and problem solving too. Learning it thru gamified platform like leetcode, hackerrank will give you lot of confidence and you can see others solving the problems bettter than you, and get inspired or get charged to beat them.
Logic and probability. AI is extremely logical and involves stochastic probability. These may sound difficult, the trick is in solving many problems so these concepts become second nature to your left and right brain. The sync of left and the right brain is trainable. Takes a considerable time when you become old. When you are young the time spent on TV and watching television has to be used for this.
Friends. The final important point is to have friends who are smarter and kind enough to take you along with them. If not physical friends then find good books that have authors who are passionate hackers and who teach.
AI is required for a world that is becoming complex everyday. Every ounce of effort counts. All the very best."

Look at the people as they are really. You will see, out of the hundreds or even thousands who pass you, many will have a smile on their face. One or two may even smile at you too.
If you realize one thing, it has to be this. Everyone is struggling with one thing or the other. There they are even with their struggles, going towards a purpose,an idea that they think will bring a change in life or keep their life from falling apart. Some positive thinking, among the relentless negativity that surrounds each one.
Those who smile and look at the world for inspiration, motivation and calmness they will get it. First smile at yourself.
The solution to your sadness(not your infatuation) is to think about the countless others who have such infatution and how they are leading their life. You will feel a strange calm comes to you. Think good for those suffering like you, your suffering reduces. The more you think new ideas will come and who knows your new purpose might emerge..

How about automating the tasks that you are doing now with python. Think about the repetitive things you do.
Data collection
Visualisation
Folding, Training and testing
All the above tasks will involve many systems and teams in your organisation. You need to find way to work in the system and still free up your time.
In parallel work on entirely new area of machine learning like reinforced learning, NLP etc. Learning the method to collect the data outside your orgainisation.
All this is possible, with libraries in Python.
Coming to your question. Once you do the above, you will start seeing challeges in many automation ideas that you want to execute. You will start reading many books, and understand howe other hackers are coding and automating.
You see where this is going? This is how every billion dollar tech company was created. The product that the founder created is the product that he wanted. Whether it is Brin and Sergey, N. Tesla, Musk, Mark, Jobs or Gates, it is same story.

Before that…
Project you need to do is,
Watch a lot of videos on mathematical problem solving and document the type of problems and their solutions.
Play lot of video games that have AI characters. Halo series and portal series are very interesting. There is invisible by Klei, Mass effect series, and Guardians of galaxy. Your imagination has to be primed first.
Read up the Robot series and Foundation series by issac Asimov. Any AI or Robot developer should dip into the contribution of Asimov(You will understand why Elon Musk decided to Colonise Mars)
Solve lot of puzzles and again document the interesting solutions.
As a side project follow couple of important companies Deep mind, Open Ai, Two minute papers etc…
You will come up with lot of project ideas and problems to solve once you do the above. Then what?
Python language is your go to choice. There are ways to learn this language visually. Any thing you learn needs to useful in this world. It can break the world or make the world, but it needs to do something. You need to visualise the solution first.
That is why I ask to play games. They help to visualise the solution. Games have immense impact on your imagination. AI needs lot of imagination and visualisation to understand and then use it creatively.
Next take the programs written by others, copy it in VSCode (the best IDE out there, all hackers and programmers use it, and it is super easy) and try to execute and check the output. You can get lot of books and courses apart from those thought at school. Read the books like a novel. Apply the programs and try to visualise what kind of solution the author of the book has preferred. Document the ideas.
Visualise what the computer did to get that output. I repeat this. This is important because computer will follow set of rules to solve a problem. You need to work with that rules. This takes visualising, time, practice, taking ideas from others and sharing new ideas.
This is the best part of learning to program and working with AI. You spend so much time trying to understand your computer, that you can find ways to make it think for itself. Even though it is thinking in numbers.
Remember Visualising is a big part in AI and programming. Have a great future. Take one step at a time."

There are countless claims on how AI has helped to creat the future. I have a simple and logical reason. AI lets you to visualise the impact of a random factor on a particular outcome.
Take an example of Car. We all have travelled in it. Recently with Uber and Ola the number of people who could travel increased drastically. instead of owning a car, renting a car is making more sense atleast in some cities. This was possible because the location of the cab and the rider could be automatically linked.
If it needs to be done in traditonal rule based programming then the lines of code required will be very large. For every product which needs connectivity with the customer the code needs to be repeated. All this repetition has been removed by AI abstraction.
Still there is lot of code, but now anybody can use it replicate their own product. This is a phenomenal change in how the world works and coding is done. This is possible only becaure of notonly AI but the entire ecosystem that formed around it.
Then there is Data. Today the Code itself has become data. The way the syntax and the algorithm is implemented can be seen as a pattern by the AI neural nets. Without that AI cannot be useful. Even the power of computing will not be able to surpass the importance of the Data. Unlike computing a scarce resource the Data is created evert second.
With the data, the pattern matching and the rule generation in programming is automated. To answer your question, that is why AI and so called “future” is here today. Use it to live and code happily."

then begin by listing the steps for doing the activity.
you will start seeing some activities have dependencies, others you have no knowledge, still others that can be done by using some form of physical mecahanisms.
The above three steps art the problem identification stage. There are couple of steps more before you can start typing on your keyboard.The data structure and mechanism to collect data is decided. The algorithm to process is decided. All these steps are like solving puzzles.
Then you use the programming language that you know to code.
The order of learning to code starts by not learning to code but to sit and solve problems. Then try solving them differently with the data structures and algorithms others have used. Follow that by reading lots and lots of code written by others and identifying how they solved the problems.

The college provides you all the necessary courses, and provides you exam and teachers to train you. When you do it yourself then, you have to find alternate for the teachers, exams and a way to train.
Teachers are easy to replace. Online courses give you the necessary teachers. Exam is also easy to replace by attending the certification exams or online examination sites.
Way to train is most difficult to replace. Training means not just repeating what is in the book or course. It means able to use your knowledge in real life scenario. This takes lot of effort and time. This effort you will put in college too, but there you will be paying for doing it. Here you will do it with WILL power.

The idea that creative people need to be famous is another challenge this “getting things done” society has gotten us into. Many creative guys start many projects and abandon them if they are not interested. They are very specific in using their time differently.

After 12 months of practice, completing all the kaggle courses, see the outcome below. You can see the associated kaggle notebook, here
The charts shows the story, and it was possible by python, and kaggle notebook. Before this 12 month of practice, I was also lost for 2 years….
So what clicked???
The solution is simple. Head to Kaggle courses page and start one course at a time. No pressure.. Go steadily and learn the chapters, and enjoy the following code exercises and getting simple answers first. You have to spend time in figuring out the correct answers, before you check their hints and solutions. (Avoid the urge to complete the exercises and move forward, I did that the first time and got lost completely)
You have to read up on the related books on the course. For example, the intro course is on Python. When you complete the course, take Python for dummies kind of book and go thru it. You will see some points you learnt in the course come in the book and explained with new example.
When you do this, you will start connecting the dots and start trying out new things with python. Then move to the next course. Do the same. Give Yourself 3 months to finish the courses. Steadily, you will start understanding the Language and the Platform. Imagination is the key here. Thinking how the concepts you are learning can be applied in real world problems, as you go through the courses is important.
If you are wondering where to get all the books, then head to Z-Library. The world's largest ebook library.
This site has every book that a aspiring teenager needs. All you need is a smartphone with big screen, and good internet connectivity. I am sure, you have these two available.
By the end of 6 months you would have read atleast 100 different books and have done lot of exercises. You will have your fav books too. That point, you can look at related things like Git, software engineerig, Data structures and read more on them specifically. All this time you will be practicing it too.
This is the way to move forward, and as you see there is lot of practicing, reading and typing involved. To get through all this, you need to have the inspiration. Motivation will take you only to some distance, the rest is covered by your inner image of what you really want to become by using the coding skils.
For me Inspiration is Nikola Tesla, and the Warren Buffett. They have given their entire lives to find how certain aspect of this reality works, and shared it with the world. Whenever I find myself lost during the practice, or in the early morning feeling tired to wake up, it is the inspiration to share my findings, and knowledge that wakes me up.
The solution works and in process makes you confident, and creative. Able to provide answers, and ideas is very empowering. All the very best for your journey. Kagglers, and the Python community, Stackoverflow are there to help when you are stopped by errors. Before asking support, google your error and see if there is solution already and try it out. Yep, that is all you need to know..

Easiest is to enrol in the courses offered by the many universities. Just take any masters degree on ML and AI to pursue. That in itself will not land you a job as is the case with any degree. You have to prove that you can use your knowledge in real world scenarios.
So as you are doing the course, start contributing to communities like Kaggle, Quora with your knowledge. There is so many real problems that can be solved, but the courses offered will not show every thing. So what to do?
Read a lot of machine learning books. It can be about the programming, the libraries, the cookbook usecases, visualisation ideas. Read atleast 250 Books. That is the important point in any career. The more you read, more your knowledge will grow. More you will contribute.
Happy life to you."

It is best you head to kaggle and take a competition dataset and try to model the data. You can show your data analysis provess followed by reliable feature selection process.
if that seems easy(which is not the case), you can start by scraping the data from the net and come up with some unique insights or finding and model based on that.

The issue is the speed with which the computer solves the equations. The hardware is simply highpowered, with more gpu along with cpu that can crunch more numbers.
There are existing cloud computing services being used widely by the datascience community. Infact the data for the below chart came from the recent survey done in the kaggle community. The data can be checked here,
The below chart was created from the Kaggle Notebook. Yes, that makes me a Kaggler. When I entered the world of data, I knew only Jupyter notebook that is now bundled with Python portable distributions. The learning curve brought me to Colab and Kaggle.
There some thing intriguing in the above chart? Many of them don’t use any of the services shown above. What they use? Their own laptops, desktops or the internal service their company IT provides. Surprised!!
The AI or machine learning is a very old technology. The idea was used in Aerospace, Automotive and other high end design decision making. Even the laptop cooling is simulated using the equations.
The story is just starting. The data and its conclusions are unpalatable to many decision makers in this world. So after doing the grunt work with the above compute services, the decisions and supporting data needs to be again visualised. If just peek in the below chart one will be astonished at the choices for the business intelligence softwares.
Because it is finally businesses that use the results coming from the AI solutions. The data needs to be made pallatable to the decision makers. In this case the decision maker is you the reader and future top shot executive or engineer deciding the fate of your company and business.
It is not the next shiny compute processor, or the quantum chip that is going to change the world. It is how these compute resources are being used. We came this far, by using very simple micro processors. Like our brain, most of these processor powers are still under utilised all over the world. Even in your own laptops and desktops.
How to tap into that processing power? Learning to Program.
Yes, that is the only way to collectively grow. Learning to program will enable and empower everyone to decide based on the data available freely out there. The power will not reside in the companies like Meta, or Google (Kaggle is part of Alphabet, they are altruistic till now). It is not how much power or what features something has, it is how creatively and aggressively the power is used…."

Being a avid fan of #videogames, I got smitten by Metaverse. Take any game you play, you will be the protagonist. You need to get something, and the game places hurdles in between. Simple.
Games are simply processes, that have strategies and tasks.
Metaverse is a glorified Massive Multiplayer Online Game. Tomorrow there is an application, which opens you or your avatar to this Metaverse. What will you do there? How long will you be there?
Will you be playing for all your life & looking at ads and others who just pixels like your avatar??? It is not logical. There is something missing.
Yes, we will be playing but we will be doing it differently. We will not control our avatars. Avatars will be Reinforced Learning or Self-supervised learning algorithms that do things for you and with others. Alphago and Alphastar are such RL algorithms. You can spawn as many avatars of yourself, and populate the metaverse(fees will be crypto!! or compute/ electric power), and get #work done
Hold on WORK!!!, no play?? Work will be the Crucial to Metaverse
Think FB or Linkedin, when these products were marketed their USP was connecting supply and demand. After many ""pivots"" their USP is still ""Connecting Supply to the Demand"". The supplies and demands can be different. So...
What will be the Demand and Supply in Metaverse?
No it is not Attention. When the 8 billion or so enter the Metaverse there will be no issue of Attention. The issue of bringing money to the economy will be solved. Work and money will be un-tied as more machines take over. What will Metaverse supply. It will be supply and demand of #connection and #Work.
WORK
Yes, it will be work that needs conscious attention of an human being that needs to solved with intuition, creativity and skill. When your avatar gets into trouble with the world or other avatars, your work starts. There are myriad of process that will be run by your avatars that are constantly learning and doing. Your avatar plays, and you direct it.
CONNECTION
When your Alexa like avatar replaces you in the phone calls, and meetings the major issue will be getting real human connection. More people start moving away from the city, to their own land and population starts reducing with increasing life expectancy, the demand for real connection will sky rocket. Human connection at level of telepathy.
What if your avatar falls in love (gets in sync) with another avatar, and you can see how it unfolds, in metaverse? (Algorithms syncing? If they can learn, then syncing will be more easier) Algorithms have created telepathic connection between two people.
There will be always people not entering metaverse, and contended being in the reality. Today we have citizens and netizens. Tomorrow we will have humans and #metavatars(#metavs for short).
What will be the next driving force for human improvement? We have to wait and see, or decide it today.
Imagination is crucial for not only human survival but to be happy. The way tech can make this happen is in our hands. Imagine well…."

In Machine learning, then Reinforcement Learning comes close to mimicing the processes humans do in reality
Human brain categorises the various stimuli to our sense organs, and give back responses to the environment. Based on the responses we give, new stimuli comes back in a different way.
Take an example of the fruits below… that is a external stimuli. The response an human gives depends on his brain, and body make up at the moment he recieves the stimuli. Consider he is hungry, his brain propels him towards the fruit and he picks it up, and eats it(response). Body generates a stimuli to the brain
This time the stimuli is reduction of hunger and brain responds by secreting dopamine. The cycle continues in many types of stimuli, and the response changes. Every stimuli, and its response has been categorised. The categories are different for every human, acoss space and time. This process is simplified “Learning mechanism” humans.
This can be verified by the recent advances in the Reinforcement Algorithms that have taken up complex challenges. Alpha Go and its successor Alpha Star has been playing games against experience players of GO/ Starcraft and winning!!! That doesn’t make them Human, in any logical sense. They are still mimicing Humans, not humans.
We live only ones. Machine Learning Models die and instantiate a trillion times. The parallel of human life just being a program, has been discussed in depth in movies and comics. In real world(if you don’t consider the games as real world), there are certain issues the AI faces. Notable of them is Time and Opportunity to fail. Fail in ways Humans fail and learn from the failures.
Many of the activities we humans do are long term focused, and single time opportunities. You cannot grow up all over, by being born today.. (not likely, unless you can clone!!!) While this can be a huge issue to RL, since RL works by making many iterations, failing and then learning from them.
The RL also does a lot of simulation in order to learn. To simulate the reality takes lot of resources, and more complicated the simulation longer it takes to run. If the simulation is not complex enough, then RL will face unforeseen challenges when it is tested in the reality. (That is not a topic to discuss here)
We are forgeting one major point. We humans are CONSCIOUS. Brain is not the center of Consciousness, the MIND is. Mind is outside our Brain, the environment itself acts as part of the Mind. The sights, smells trigger hidden memories, don’t they. RLs cannot really absorb the details from the reality surrounding it in a way we are doing. They are not Conscious, the way we humans are."

There are similar conditions in programming that processor executes. In computers, the sub-routines abstract the complexity of the routine and leave it to the experts. Even the sub-routines act as a security to avoid the sensitive data being leaked.
Most of the sub-routines will take care of low level heavy lifting work like writing numbers , objects to the memory and retriving it when required.

Regular RPA involves using the UI to manually program the process automation. In process mining, the program tries to learn the steps necessary to complete a task, say to get shipping order, fill a billing Invoice, mail it to the customer.

Blockchain gives a way to look at the world with distributed trust and get data that is very reliable and automated.
There are so many apps that collect your wants, needs and demands. These apps(read any app that is online) have some usefulness, so we use them and share our data. How about the activity that we do offline? This is done with sensors that are trustable by central body. Most cases it is humans collecting the data. Web3 enters this bottleneck area.
With help of distributed network, and IOT the real world physical data is collected. Then AI enters to leverage the power of algorithms to help those in need of taking decisions.
The above line looks so simple, and the moment you unpack the underlying technical complexity surfaces. Do a bit more research. The world with IOT and Blockchain can turn in to a videogame called watchdogs. In that the AI regenerates the crime scene. That, is the ultimate use case of Blockchain and Iot.
The concept of metaverse, real life simulation is also tied to the distributoed way of getting the data and showing it to the consumer. The reality that we live itself is possible because much of the sensor lies with ourself and our brain does the analysis. We react pretty quick. With the advent of Blockchain the entire cities, organisations can become like a huge organism. That can see, hear, learn and feel itself. (We are pretty long way from that though)
Its a wonderful world, do some more research. Take some open courses to learn about the workings of the Blockchain. The things will become more clear."

Today, to find recipe for a vegetable that you see in the market, Google lens is used. So the ideas can be very creative
The industry that uses NLP the most is Finance, Marketing, Medicine and automation industry. The chatbots like Ok google and Siri are work of NLP. The NLP is beginning to enter auditing and legal domains due to the effort required by the people in these domains. There are efforts to replace the scoring teacher for exams by NLP. There is a recentl Kaggle competition that launched. Take a look.

That is what creates the “Viral” effect. Secondly Memes themselves rides on the idea that is very familiar and memorable.
Algorithm is tasked with populating the things that your friends have watched, liked or commented. These are 3 simple activities. When 150 friends do any one of the action, your page updates.
Multiply that with other social media sites like twitter, linkedin joining with the algorithms running on your social media site. The speed with which the fake news propagates is very fast.
Humans are easily influenced by “Authority”. When the fake news is said in a authoritative tone, wording, with legitimate looking web url, we believe it to be true. Forward it to the social media pages, with just commenting or liking. The algorithm then spreads the news like a virus on your friends’ network. If one of your 150 friends sees it, and does like or comment the cycle begins.
Influencers who gather millions of followers or subscribers can create instant viral effect, by propagating the news to everyone in their followers’ list. Just a click.
This is all possible because of how the algorithms are written, and how they interact with each other. The fake news has been around for long time, only now the algorithms have made it so easy to move the news fast. This effect can be seen in how the world market reacts to any fearful or bad news.
Algorithms or social media sites are just tools like traditional media like news paper. They are only conduits. Only we humans have to learn, and be wary of what we consume and like."

In a land where there is no sugar the Mehua flower is Sugar. Where can your skills be used? That research must have lead you to quora the first place. Aspiring to be a cyber security or data scientist lies in not just about finding a job, but creating many jobs…. That could be an edge, which many entrepreneur do.
What is required now is to think of completely new professions altogether. Something very basic.
Ability to enter any field and master it at rapid pace. That seems to be great edge. My being an evangelist of mastery, advicing that, “Jack of all Trades” is an edge feels hypocritical. Things that we have to master has started to change.
Basic way we learn is getting altered by AI. It is no longer mandatory to master repetitive work through repetition. It can be programmed. Only the problem has to be looked from engineering and problem solving attitude. Any real world problem can be converted to algorithm or models now. That is very powerful.
Abstracting the working of ML, Cyber and SW Development is under rapid progress in AI field. Think about these professions, you can find frameworks, heuristics and certifications that one learns for years to master. All of these on top of undergraduate engineering course.
Really, is this necessary? Why to create such a burden on the children by making them study every subject under the universe and the make them feel bad when they arw unable to use it? Is the time spent is productive for our youth?

The idea is unsupervised learning can provide patterns that humans or the systems did not think about. This kind of learning can be very useful when there are more dimensions (features), especially in Computer Vision, Time series analysis and NLP.
Supervised learning models have their benefits too. The benefit is, we get “Free Products”. Take quora, a free product where you get the answer for many different questions. The data is created by users and it is labeled by them and shared to quora engineers. Who can make models out of it.
One question that the quora data can answer,
Who is most likely to answer the next question you have?
Quora can look at all the questions that one person has answered, and classify whether that person can answer your question using Natural Language processing models.
Even a simple regression analysis on, how many question one person has answered till date, can be used to forecast the future.

I love to type. Yes, it is like how artist loves his brush. I love to type with only my right hand and use my left for doing some easy task like drinking tea while I type. It is possible with right hand Dvorak keyboard layout. There will be NO mouse near me. This is another way to force myself to learn shortcuts.
With this kind of setup, learning to use shortcuts on gmail is more than a necessity for me. I first learned the short cut keys by seeing the short cut help page for every action I need to do on gmail. The learning curve was pretty steep.
Once learned and my finger memorized the short cuts then it is breeze from that moment. Mostly I use mouse only when the gmail option doesn't have a shortcut for an action.
It is simple really if you have seen the hackers and uber programmers type. They use the key board like a pianist playing. The sound the keyboard makes will be mesmerising. This is possible with the inspiration and motivation.

During a lunch at office, topic of what we really want to become or create came up. I instinctively told, to make “Robots that Think”. All I got was blank stares from my colleagues. In fact, I was clueless on where to even begin.
I started training for the machine learning and python programming. I explored the ROS system that is predominant in building robot simulation. The search further lead to computer vision and AI systems. Forecasting techniques using the RNN, LSTM and other algorithms. None of the AI sounding algorithms were really “Intelligence”
So did I find the answer?
The answer was already known to me. I am a trained public speaker and influencer. Speakers believe that words carry lot more power than the pictures. Words can be used to program the minds. Even our self-talk can alter our state of thinking. I had known this all along, and did not think about Natural Language programming.
When I was losing hope in finding the key to thoughts, and thinking I was searching for some books on Natural Language Programming. One of the books hit the cord and resonated.
NLPIA has the introduction to NLP like no other. The authors have extensive experience, and tied the lose ends to the “Thinking” problem of the robots. In fact, there are so many scientists working with the same passion and vision. “To Make the Robots (bots) think”. MS already released “Tay”, an AI Bot which became very anti-social, and was taken down.

Your answer to a tech question might change you from a social media specialist to a game design analyst? That is how a Classification AI will work. So you will get a job, but may not be the one you applied for.
Every thing in AI is about features. With features comes classification and interpolation. Every thing about you will be a list of dimensions, and the answers that you give for the question, you guessed it, again they are list of dimensions.
AI that you see today in resume classification is very primitive. Those that take interviews can be real tricky, like playing a game. So being smart is very important and talking your way around AI can be fun too. How? There will be lot more opportunity for you to prepare for the interview by attending fake interviews with AIs. I am jumping ahead.
The AI that might interview you will be a mix of reinforced learning machine with some form of classification machine learning algorithms attached. Here you need to improve yourself in multiple dimensions and in each dimensions you need to skill yourself to multiple expertise levels.
Showing confidence in your expression, having relaxed attitude and can do perspective can add up to your success in interview. AI will take note of these dimensions too and factor it in the model it builds of your answers. The AI will be programmed to get the best model employee.
All the very best. You better be the best."

AI is not the human robot that we see on the movies. That kind of robot will use reinforced learning combined with neural networks. Here the neural networks are simply a mesh of equations that are populated by coefficients. (Bit of mathematics there)
You can also work on interaction design. This is part where you work out how the user will use the application or the product. Think in these lines. The product might have AI underneath it like the Miko AI shown above.
Going into AI as a career also can be creative in a mathematical way of solving problems that are multidimensional. Think wisely before taking the step towards AI. Have a great future."

If you have interest in trading then better take a certificate courses from any of the markets that trade instruments. As a support, you can do an undergrad course in science or commerce that is easy on your time.
Trading is more about playing with yourself. Greed, Fear, Hope and Faith create lot of challenges in the market. When you take profit, you take it without 2nd thoughts and same is true for taking losses too. Difference is, you know the what is going to be your profit before you enter the trade. Also, you know how much you are going to stake.
Look at life itself as a career. You keep your mindset free from noise like comparison, jealousy and even hatred. These feelings easily derail you from making money. Keep a mind filled with care for yourself and those around you.
Trading profits are for reintroducing into new trades or to safeguarding the losses made by other trades. Never to be taken out and spent on material things. Living a life of luxury is possible as a trader after you have given up the need for luxury. Those top traders do the trading for that thrill and enjoyment, and earn that much from it.
None of these will be thought in college. So work on it by yourself. Have a great trading future."

These ethics are very stringent and the practitioner and the researcher follow it closely. So from the point of AI research, the way they work is kept ethical.
Whether we should handover our “future” to others like the researchers, there is always alternative. You decide to take the future in your hand and start learning about how the research is done. How the output and models are created. (Its easy)

There has already been a tonne of research out there and companies are being built on top of those research.
The above links explain what is AEI, which I was curious to understand first. Then once I read about it, there is nothing new about it. I would suggest you to begin by reading the below two books
F Chollet’s Deep learning with Python and
Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On Apply modern RL methods
These two books provide wealth of information about the state of art heuristics to create models from the data, and then use that model to predict things in the real world.
In AEI, the predictions are simply the human emotions. Consider the different emotions as different configuration of same face. This adds the complication that, billions of human faces can wear these configuration, without any warnings. Your work will be predict it.
The Kaggle competition platform, and the Google research group is doing so much research, and shared to the world. The data which is clean and labelled is also available. All you need is take these data, and start your research.
I have just shown the horizon of the deep learning and AEI models with face recognition. There are other dimensions to emotion recognition like, voice analytics, breathing pattern analytics and body language. These areas of research is ongoing, and opens up new ways of creating immersion in this world.

There is math and problem solving involved. If you are afraid of math, then it will take the fun of many things, not just AI.
If someone says that they are afraid of math, reality they are having 2 challenges. One is they are LAZY, and other is they are AFRAID to fail.
Math is beautiful. As the saying goes, beauty is in the “Eye of the Beholder”. I am good at solving mathematic puzzles, business challenges and calculate the returns on my investment. Basic tasks are helpful for daily lives. To have fun with mathematics is to begin abstracting the real life challenges into mathematical equations, and models. See how the models perform, and tweak it.
Take a look at the following course on computational thinking, which provides an intuitive way to think about AI, ML and other prediction softwares.
This course really answers your question with lots of hands on examples, and finally equips you to understand the most complex of the models, that predict the weather. So, to understand math behind these models, one has to be spend time and effort.
As already informed, being lazy and afraid spending time that might not give any output is the major challenge. So work on that, rest of the life will be fun."

The output is a masive “model”. Model is a very long equation in algebraic terms. This is already covered.
How does this model know “my” face?
Someone has to still say to the convnet that, it is “your” face.
One of the ways this is done using numerous photos we upload on social sites and tag the photos to names.
Tagging is a way to help the neural network learn about the “features” of your face. It doesn't copy your face like how we humans see it. During learning the network converts your face as a “set of signals” that switches on/off the neurons in each layer and then assigns that pattern to your name “tag”.
When your face in reality is shown to the face recognition camera, it predicts with sufficient accuracy that it is your face.
Registering: When you enable face in your device, it asks you to show your face. It takes so many pictures of your face in multiple directions at high speed. Then sends it into the model and enables your model to “learn” your face. It doesn't copy your current face, it only model your face as mathematical equation.
Either way, the model will know the mathematics of your face and it will get stored in the server of the device. (Data of your ‘feature’, like face, finger print is always given away. We are not discussing what can be the data used for…)
This kind of recognition, is unlike how the humans recognize. The internal mechanism in our brain is very different. So neural nets are not like our brains neural network. The brain doesn't create equations.
Hope the idea is clear."

What we do today with code? We build software and make hardware to do what humans either cannot do or don't want to do. We will continue doing that.
There are many paradigms of building the code, among them the Object programming and functional programming has mostly brought us this far. Objects with specific features or methods were created, which then got passed thru the functions to get the output
How might a new paradigm change this?
Reinforced Learning(RL) will change the way the objects and functions are designed. The programs or functions will write the functions for newer problems.
How might this be possible?
RL is used for making programs that help to navigate problems by learning the constraints and possibilities. Brute force problem solving and learning is useful in games. The real world problems will become the games that RL will solve.
And what will humans do?
We will create the GAMES
Creating games today is called management. Whether entrepreneur or an employee, they are players in the game where the state, investors and customers are the game masters. Seeing this big picture creates a very unique experience.
Tomorrow, everyone will create games and the games depend on ideas and themes. More the games are played the RL will be able to solve the challenges using the results it learns. Games will start competing. The advantage of having entertainment is only the way forward when everything will be done for us. This time with Robots, that are made of metal and not meat."

These libraries allow for automated trading too.
Learning curve is pretty steep and understanding the market ks necessary for these libraries. Also quantopian closed shop because the open sourcing the strategies did not make money as they expected.
All the above solution involves humans creating the strategies. To involve AI means the algorithms have to be reinforced learning only. There are many libraries that are simple to implement, but complex to understand. It is difficult to give the money to a program that works on very rigid rules and values.

This is apt for programming languages.
You need tbe skill to solve the problem. Some languages need more elaborate set up before you solve the problem. While others may need little or no setup. Python is later kind. Everything is abstracted away and you are given functions and objects to work.
Learning C and C++, even assembly language can make your life very easy. Easy because you will build your own stuff. That is like building your own house. It is done in places where there is no choice. Today there are so many people sharing their code and libraries. You have to just use them.
Having good grasp on algorithms, data structure can make a huge difference, but not really necessary. It does help you if you know an algorithm exist and it solves the problem you are having.
Start learning the easy part of the computer. The challenging part can be taken care by the scientist and engineers. Being the user of the code, you support those who write the algorithms for you. I always thank the open source community for bringing us most of the tech we use today. They are happy to be supported in return, by our data and usage information. It is a symbiotic ecosystem.
Its worth learning C or C++. There are better ways to solve the challenges you and the in society faces and contribute towards it. Think in this way, and if you learning C and contribute after 5 years, with language like Python or R, it will reduce to 1.5 years.

Moment the system gets triggered is controlled by the model of the real world.
In case of AI, the program is written by humans still. The model of the control system is learnt using neural network of matrices, which acts more precisely than the human created model. How and Why is fascinating, but beyond this answer.
Programming is not completely done by the AI. AI is still stuck inside the libraries and the functions that can work in a very specific processor or GPU. The interface between the AI model and the real world is established by humans and the necessary hardware.

It is a Quantum leap considering the type of code written and the output achieved. A linear tree searching GO game space would have taken eons, while the RL makes it possible to do it in couple of minutes.
We can learn very different moves and the unique strategy to only win instead of going behind many different goals. 9 dan GO player learnt to play very differently. After playing Alpha Go he did not lose to any human player…
All these are just the beginning. Based on newer algorithms that use curiosity to search the game spaces, and breakdown the end goals into series of sub goals the development is happening very fast. March towards AGI is getting faster.
The key for AGI is creating a kind of emergent behavior between multi million RL AI agents. Their goals and learnings have to work together. That will lead to near conscious AI.

I want to argue against the premise that, “Programmers need smartness”
Ingredients: Dumb neural nets program themselves by playing the game a 100 thousand times. So to be a programmer you need that secret sauce called ability to break problems into simple steps, perseverance and relentlessness.
Reciepe: Smartness or any other esoteric skill help to speed up your work and submit for testing. That can be done by networks of artificial neurons. You as a human should be aware of which data to use for training the neural net and which way to get the output. These don't need smartness
Imagination: Seeing your work change the real world is very satisfying and empowering. When you build and others use and enjoy, the happiness is different. Money cannot buy that or even your incentives don't come near that. When you imagine that happiness and work, then all the world's smartness won't stand the chance.

Scientists contribute. Davinci, Enstien, Tesla, Neumann, Shanon, Rutherford were doing data science to test their theories. They contributed to the community, society and the world as a whole.
All these people were taken care by someone, while they were busy doing their scientific work. Yes, they did struggle. Tesla had to dig the ditch, when is A/C motor patent was to be recognised. Davinci constantly searched for patrons, who can sustain him. They did not seek out the work, the work sought them out.
Learn the skills of Data Science for that one purpose. To Contribute. To open your own eyes and that of others, who are “data blind”. It is fascinating to see the solutions that experience data scientists come up with, because they love to contribute. When their contribution is recognised by those who are looking for talent, then the interview is taken care by itself.
Benefit of Offline/ College course is the NETWORK. You meet people who know people in industry, looking for talent. Colleges provide this network for the fee they charge. The study is done by you, whther offline / online.

They have to be exposed to lot of board games with the tutoring about “solving” the game.
It is rare to find these in coding classes, since their objective is to get your kid used to the computers and the programming languages.
Instead of coding class, give your kid the strategy games to play on the computer, and slowly get them to learn about the computers. The challenge they face, when they want to play the game will push them to learn more than what any coding class can give.
Coding is like building Lego toys. The instinct to build comes from the mindset to solve problems.
Get a raspberry pi and start introducing them to fascinating world of Linux, networking, bluetooth, wireless and much more. The device itself is a challenge. If your kid breaks it, then it is fine get a new one. Show him, that “breaking things” are fine.
Hackers are created when they are given challenges that seems insurmountable. The best coding classes are their “Homework”. Show them how your kid can complete the Homework fast and then go do what he likes… There you will have a very motivated and inspired kid.
